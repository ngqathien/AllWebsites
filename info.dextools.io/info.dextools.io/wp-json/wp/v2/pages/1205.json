The Company is not responsible for any discrepancies that may arise between the printed version and the electronic version of the information contained in this website.<\/p>\n<p>Without prejudice to the provisions of the preceding paragraph, the copying, duplication, redistribution, electronic reproduction, printing, commercialization, marketing or any other use that may be made of the contents of this Web site, in whole or in part, whether in the form of written or graphic documents, is forbidden, even when citing the written or graphic documents; The content of this Web site, in whole or in part, whether in the form of written or graphic documents, may not be reproduced, reproduced electronically, printed, marketed, sold, traded, or otherwise exploited in any way, even if the source is cited, without the prior written consent of the Company.<\/p>\n<h3>Severe warning<\/h3>\n<p>STRADEXT DEFI SOLUTIONS_SL wishes to expressly inform the users of its Website of the following circumstances related to the activity carried out in connection with the cryptocurrency and other cryptoassets markets:<\/p>\n<p>First.- Las inversiones en criptoactivos y el rendimiento obtenido de las mismas puede experimentar alteraciones significativas de valor, tanto al alza como a la baja, pudiendo incluso llegar a perderse la totalidad del importe invertido.<\/p>\n<p>Second.- En particular, las inversiones realizadas en proyectos que se encuentren en fases iniciales de desarrollo o \u00abstart-up\u00bb comportan siempre un alto nivel de riesgo, por lo que resulta necesario entender adecuadamente su modelo de negocio.<\/p>\n<p>Third.- As an investment object, cryptoassets are not covered by customer protection mechanisms such as the Deposit Guarantee Fund or the Investor Guarantee Fund. Their prices are constituted in the absence of mechanisms that ensure their correct formation, such as those used in the regulated securities markets.<\/p>\n<p>Fourth.- The lack of liquidity of many cryptoassets can make it difficult and even impossible for investors to unwind their investments without suffering significant losses, as their circulation among both retail and professional investors can be very limited.<\/p>\n<p>Fifth.- Distributed log technologies are still at an early stage of maturity, with many of these networks having been created only recently, so they may not be sufficiently tested and there may be significant flaws in their operation and security.<\/p>\n<p>Sixth.- The recording of transactions in networks based on distributed registry technology works through consensus protocols that may be susceptible to attacks that attempt to modify the registry, and in the event of success, there would be no alternative registry to support such transactions and therefore the balances corresponding to the public keys, and all cryptoassets could be lost.<\/p>\n<p>Seventh.- The anonymity facilities that cryptoassets can provide make them a target for cybercriminals, since in the case of stealing credentials or private keys they can transfer the cryptoassets to addresses that make it difficult or impossible to recover them.<\/p>\n<p>Eighth.- The custody of crypto-assets is a very important responsibility since they can be lost in their entirety in the event of theft or loss of the private keys. It is therefore necessary for investors to make sure about the entity in charge of the custody of the crypto-assets advertised, the country in which it is carried out and the applicable legal framework.<\/p>\n<p>Ninth.- The acceptance of cryptoassets as a means of payment is still very limited and there is no legal obligation to accept them.<\/p>\n<p>Tenth.- When the information society service provider is not located in a European Union country, the resolution of any dispute may be costly and fall outside the jurisdiction of the authorities of the investor&#8217;s home state.<\/p>\n<h3>Privacy policy<\/h3>\n<p>Users of this Website are informed that STRADEXT DEFI SOLUTIONS_SL does not collect or process their personal data in connection with the provision of its information service.
