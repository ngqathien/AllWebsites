The users have plenty of helpful resources at their disposal, such as a useful price and alerts bot and also DEXTscore for the different tokens, which gives the user an idea about their reliability as a guideline to prevent scams.

Bad credit tokens have fallen, but also other theoretically stable such as UST from Terra\/Luna. Even leading companies like FTX or BlockFi have also been affected (sometimes because its bad practices). For its part, the DEXTools native token ($DEXT) has weathered the storm well with some rises even, such as the most recent one in November.<strong> At the beginning of the Project 200 million $DEXT tokens were created,<\/strong> after burning 50 Million from the team, our deflationary system mechanism with a monthly burn by the team it\u2019s working better than ever so its current circulation is lowering everyday.<\/p>\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/info.dextools.io\/the-biggest-dext-token-burn-in-the-history-of-dextools-by-now\/\">*Update: Recently in March 2023, DEXTools just burned 3M more tokens<\/a> (3% of our circulating supply).
