The approval in parliament, with 499 votes in favor, 28 against, and 93 abstentions, is the first step towards its final endorsement, which will come after going through the Council, where it will be definitively processed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The aim of the European Union&#8217;s Artificial Intelligence Act is to set limits on AI in areas related to privacy, human rights, and the very existence of human beings.<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>The privacy issue<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The law will prohibit the use of artificial intelligence in video surveillance cameras in public spaces, both in real-time and retrospectively. The exception will be if there are serious crimes being investigated by the police, with prior judicial authorization.<\/li>\n<li>The law will also deny the creation of biometric categories based on identity, such as gender, ethnicity, religion, etc. Nor will it allow predictive policing systems based on profiling or criminal records, as well as the use of AI for face recognition in law enforcement, workplaces, or education.<\/li>\n<li>Furthermore, it will not be possible to create databases of individuals using images taken from the internet or closed-circuit television. In the case of generative artificial intelligence models like ChatGPT, DALL-e, Bing with AI, Stable Diffusion, Google Bard, etc., the EU will require them to be registered in a database before being commercialized.<\/li>\n<li>These AI models will have to avoid responses that pose a risk to health, safety, fundamental rights, the environment, democracy, and the rule of law. <strong>All content generated by AI will need to be indicated by the AI itself with a watermark or explanatory text about its origin.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Moreover, these models will have to specify the copyrighted data they have used for their development. In some cases, artificial intelligence may be exempt from these rules, for example, in research projects or open-source AI.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>The bright side of AI and its application in crypto world<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>One of the key areas where AI has made significant contributions to cryptocurrencies is in <a href=\"https:\/\/info.dextools.io\/crypto-glossary\/trading-bot\/\">trading.<\/a> AI-powered trading algorithms can analyze market trends, historical data, news sentiment, and social media feeds to make informed decisions about buying, selling, or holding crypto assets. These algorithms can execute trades at speeds and <a href=\"https:\/\/info.dextools.io\/crypto-glossary\/trading-volume\/\">volumes<\/a> that surpass human capabilities, leading to increased efficiency and <a href=\"https:\/\/info.dextools.io\/crypto-glossary\/liquidity\/\">liquidity<\/a> in the market.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, AI can assist in fraud detection and prevention within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. By analyzing transactional patterns and identifying suspicious activities, AI algorithms can help detect fraudulent transactions, protecting investors from potential<a href=\"https:\/\/info.dextools.io\/crypto-glossary\/scam\/\"> scams<\/a> and enhancing the overall security of the cryptocurrency market.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dextools.io\/app\/en\/pairs\">DEXTools app<\/a> itself, users can count on the protection of advanced analytical tools for safer trading, such as GoPlus Security, Hapi, Quick Intel &amp; TokenSniffer. They also have <a href=\"https:\/\/info.dextools.io\/crypto-glossary\/dextscore\/\">DEXTScore<\/a> (for rating the quality of tokens), as well as a new <a href=\"https:\/\/info.dextools.io\/new-dextools-price-bot-step-by-step-guide-token-pair-trading\/\">DEXTools Price Bot<\/a> and New Pairs Bot.<\/strong><\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Another area where AI is revolutionizing cryptocurrencies is in the field of <a href=\"https:\/\/info.dextools.io\/crypto-glossary\/smart-contract\/\">smart contracts.<\/a> Smart contracts are self-executing agreements with predefined conditions, and AI can enhance their functionality by automating the verification and execution processes. AI algorithms can assess the conditions and outcomes of smart contracts, ensuring accuracy, transparency, and trust in decentralized <a href=\"https:\/\/info.dextools.io\/crypto-glossary\/defi\/\">DeFi<\/a> transactions.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants are being deployed in the cryptocurrency industry to provide real-time customer support, answer queries, and facilitate transactions. These chatbots can leverage natural language processing and machine learning techniques to understand and respond to user inquiries, improving user experience and accessibility.<\/p>\n<h2>OpenAI and the AI-based token trend<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>OpenAI, the U.S.-based company known for the popular ChatGPT application, has recently introduced a new version of its software: GPT-4, which OpenAI claims is 1,000 times more advanced than previous versions. The main improvement lies in the software&#8217;s search functionality,<strong> which now allows images to be included in addition to text.<\/strong> The initial release of the original ChatGPT version of OpenAI in November last year caused a significant change in the AI landscape. Consequently, several cryptographic AI tokens have experienced significant price spikes driven by market enthusiasm,<strong> generating something similar to the hype created by the meme season tokens we discussed<a href=\"https:\/\/info.dextools.io\/meme-season-the-hype-behind-pepe-token\/\"> in a previous article.<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h2>Other use cases<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Apart from cryptocurrency trading, the potential technological use cases for AIs are multiple and cover a wide range of areas, such as the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Video games, Online shopping, Rideshare Apps, Navigation Apps, Smart Homes, 3D Photography, Security and Surveillance, Facial Recognition, Media Recommendations, Smart Assistants (like Amazon\u2019s Alexa), Spam Filters, Video Summaries, Online Banking, Autonomous Vehicles\u2026 and much more.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>But&#8230;what are AIs actually?<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid alignnone wp-image-2462\" src=\"https:\/\/info.dextools.io\/content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AI-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"AIs and Human beings.

It encompasses the creation of computer systems or algorithms capable of analyzing, interpreting, learning from data, and making decisions or predictions based on such analysis. AI encompasses diverse subfields such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>AI systems are crafted to perceive their surroundings, comprehend information, reason, make decisions, and even interact with humans in a manner that imitates human intelligence.<\/strong> They can be trained to identify patterns, adapt to new circumstances, and continually enhance their performance through iterative learning processes.<\/p>\n<h2>Why have Artificial Intelligences become trendy?<\/h2>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) have ceased to be the plot of a futuristic movie to emerge strongly in the present as a fact full of possibilities, but also full of uncertainty and risks in the face of the new paradigm it brings.<\/p>\n<p>Although there is a lot of talk about Artificial Intelligence applied to the creation of complex images from text as in the case of Dall-e or Midjourney, the possibilities of AI are much more extensive and complex than its mere creative use, which, in the realm of music, for example, could include the legendary musician <strong>Paul McCartney<\/strong> himself, who has used artificial intelligence (AI) to help create what he calls &#8220;the final Beatles record&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>He made the announcement on a BBC Radio program, where he detailed that the AI technology had been used to &#8220;pull&#8221; John Lennon&#8217;s voice from an old demo, so he could complete the song.<\/p>\n<p>Anecdotes aside and beyond creativity and art, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful technology that is transforming various industries, and the world of cryptocurrencies is no exception. <strong>AI&#8217;s ability to analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and make accurate predictions has significant implications for the cryptocurrency market.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>The worrying side<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Once AIs have entered with force to revolutionize the social and technological landscape, concerns about their possible fraudulent or harmful uses, and about their influence on the labor market and the privacy of individuals, have also skyrocketed. And uncertainty has also grown about how and to what extent AIs will be able to transform the world&#8217;s socioeconomic reality in the near future.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In addition, there is concern that AIs will create a generation and even employment gap among users,<\/strong> similar to that generated in the past by the emergence of the so-called &#8220;network of networks&#8221;: the Internet itself.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, in an <a href=\"https:\/\/futureoflife.org\/open-letter\/pause-giant-ai-experiments\/\">open letter<\/a> published in March, 2023 by the Future of Life Institute, <strong>Elon Musk<\/strong>, Apple co-founder <strong>Steve Wozniak<\/strong> and a number of other 1000 technology leaders warned that powerful AI systems should only be developed when there is certainty that the effects will be positive and the risks controllable.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed-container\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">More than 1,000 technology leaders and researchers, including Elon Musk, signed an open letter urging a pause in the development of the most powerful artificial intelligence systems, warning that AI tools present \u201cprofound risks to society and humanity.\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/6lEG5DBqOb\">https:\/\/t.co\/6lEG5DBqOb<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; The New York Times (@nytimes) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nytimes\/status\/1641136990753103872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 29, 2023<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In Elon Musk&#8217;s own words: &#8220;I think AI poses a greater risk to society than cars, airplanes or medicine. <strong>We need some kind of regulatory authority or something to oversee development.
