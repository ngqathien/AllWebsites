<h1></h1>
<h1>Enhancing Binance’s Mainnet</h1>
<p><strong>The primary objective of the project is to provide additional scalability, availability, and security to Binance&#8217;s main blockchain network.</strong> Currently, BNB Chain processes approximately 2,000 transactions per second at a fee of $0.10 per transaction. Meanwhile, opBNB&#8217;s stated performance is over 4,000 transactions per second with an average transaction cost below $0.005.</p>
<p>Furthermore, opBNB will help optimize data availability and cache level, as well as enable concurrent transaction processing. <strong>The new L2 protocol has also implemented a fraud-checking scheme to further ensure system reliability.</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, developers are provided with a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) service layer, simplifying the process of technological integration. At the same time, EVM interoperability allows opBNB to interact with <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/smart-contract/">smart contracts</a>, networks, and <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/erc-20/">ERC-20</a> token standards based on <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/ethereum/">Ethereum.</a> All of this enables developers to focus on application development without worrying about the complexities of Layer 2 scaling.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Addressing the Scalability Challenge</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BNB launches opBNB Testnet as a response to the<a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/scalability/"> scalability</a> challenge that has hindered widespread adoption of blockchain technology. As a layer 2 chain compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), opBNB utilizes the Optimism OP Stack to enhance BSC scalability while maintaining affordability and security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Here&#8217;s how opBNB improves scalability:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimistic Rollups. </strong>They are  the underlying concept behind opBNB, which aims to reduce the computational load on the main chain by executing transactions off-chain and only posting transaction data on-chain as call data. This approach significantly improves scalability by bundling multiple transactions together before submitting them to the main chain.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Empowering Scalability. </strong>By combining the robust capabilities of BSC with opBNB&#8217;s dedicated features, such as streamlined data access, improved cache system, and optimized submission process algorithm (batcher), opBNB pushes the gas limit to an impressive 100M, surpassing Optimism&#8217;s 30M. This enhancement enables opBNB to handle over 4000 transfer transactions per second while keeping the average transaction cost below 0.005 USD.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ensuring Transaction Validity with Fraud-Proving Scheme. </strong>BNB launches opBNB Testnet to implement a fraud-proving scheme to guarantee transaction validity. In this way, anyone can challenge the results of a rollup transaction by computing a fraud proof. Thus, successful challenges result in re-execution of the transaction(s), maintaining the integrity of the network.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits for Projects and Developers: </strong>developers utilizing opBNB gain access to a robust and EVM-compatible platform that fosters the creation of open ecosystems. The opBNB team has contributed significantly to the Optimism Stack, supporting the expansion of Layer 2 solutions. <strong>Leveraging this stack simplifies the process for EVM developers to migrate or extend their applications to BSC, reaching a wider audience and accessing more resources as a result.<br />
</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, projects can leverage opBNB&#8217;s improved throughput and significantly lower transaction costs, enhancing the user experience for their customers. Additionally, projects that previously struggled with high transaction volumes on BSC can thrive with opBNB&#8217;s increased scalability!</p>
<h2>But&#8230; what is a testnet, exactly?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/testnet/">testnet</a> is a dedicated blockchain network designed specifically for testing purposes. <strong>It functions as a virtual environment where developers and users can experiment with new features, evaluate smart contracts, and explore various functionalities without involving real or valuable assets.</strong></p>
<p>Testnets replicate the essential capabilities of the mainnet, which is the live or production blockchain network. However, they operate under different rules and parameters.<strong> Typically, testnets have their own distinct tokens that hold no monetary value, enabling users to conduct transactions and interact with the network without any financial risks.</strong></p>
<p>The primary purpose of testnets is to provide developers with a secure and controlled space to identify and address potential bugs or vulnerabilities in smart contracts and blockchain protocols before deploying them on the mainnet. Various cryptocurrencies have their own designated testnets, and developers and users can access these testnets through specialized software or tools provided by the cryptocurrency&#8217;s development team.</p>
<h2>What is a mainnet?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/mainnet/">mainnet</a> refers to the operational blockchain network of a specific cryptocurrency. <strong>It is the fully functional version of the blockchain that supports real transactions and involves the use of actual assets and funds.</strong></p>
<p>The mainnet represents the official implementation of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s protocol and serves as the live environment, where users can engage in various activities such as <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/p2p-dex/">peer-to-peer</a> transfers, execution of smart contracts, and other network operations. It operates using real tokens or coins that possess financial value and can be traded, utilized, or held within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>
<p>Unlike testnets or development environments, the mainnet is the publicly accessible network that allows users, investors, and developers to interact with the cryptocurrency&#8217;s features and services. <strong>Transactions and operations conducted on the mainnet are considered valid and permanent as they are recorded on the official blockchain ledger.</strong></p>
<p>The stability, security, and performance of a mainnet are of utmost importance for the success and credibility of a cryptocurrency. Developers continually strive to improve the mainnet&#8217;s functionalities, address any potential vulnerabilities, and ensure its seamless operation. Consequently, it serves as the foundation of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, enabling real-world transactions and fostering user engagement.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>And what is scalability in DeFi?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In broad terms,<a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/scalability/"> scalability</a> refers to the capacity of the underlying blockchain network or platform to handle a larger volume of transactions and users while maintaining optimal performance, security, and cost-effectiveness. In <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/defi/">DeFi</a> space, scalability is a pressing issue because popular blockchains like <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> have encountered limitations in processing transactions. As the user base and transaction load expand, network congestion, slower confirmation times, and elevated transaction fees become prevalent, hindering user experience and impeding widespread adoption.</p>
<h2>Solutions to improve scalability</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To address scalability concerns in crypto and DeFi, various solutions have been proposed and implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Layer 2 Solutions:</strong> these protocols operate on top of existing blockchains and aim to enhance scalability by conducting some transactions off-chain. Layer 2 solutions, such as the Lightning Network for Bitcoin and Ethereum&#8217;s Optimistic Rollups and zkRollups, enable faster and more cost-effective transactions by executing them outside the main blockchain while preserving the security of the underlying network.</li>
<li><strong>Sharding:</strong> this approach involves dividing the blockchain network into smaller interconnected segments called shards. Each shard can process its own transactions and smart contracts independently, significantly augmenting the network&#8217;s transaction throughput.</li>
<li><strong>Sidechains:</strong> they are separate chains that interoperate with the main blockchain. They handle a subset of transactions and smart contracts, alleviating congestion on the primary blockchain and enabling faster, more scalable processing.</li>
<li><strong>Blockchain Interoperability:</strong> interoperability establish connections between multiple blockchain networks, enabling the transfer of assets and data across different chains. By establishing bridges between blockchains, these solutions mitigate congestion on a single chain and distribute the workload across multiple networks.</li>
<li><strong>Optimizations and Upgrades</strong>: Blockchain protocols continuously undergo refinements and upgrades to enhance scalability. This can involve improvements in consensus algorithms, network protocols, and transaction validation mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scalability is a vital consideration for DeFi platforms, as it enables them to accommodate increasing numbers of users and transactions. By implementing scalable solutions, these platforms can support growing adoption, expedite transaction speeds, reduce <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/transaction-fee/">transaction fees,</a> and enhaence overall user experiences.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Finally, let&#8217;s summarize the benefits of opBNB:</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Enhanced Scalability:</strong> opBNB supports over 4000 transfer transactions per second, which is ideal for applications with large daily active users. Developers can, therefore, ensure smooth and uninterrupted operations without worrying about network congestion. Lower transaction costs below USD 0.005 make it feasible to create applications requiring high-frequency micro-transactions, attracting more users and boosting adoption rates.</li>
<li><strong>EVM Compatibility:</strong> opBNB&#8217;s EVM compatibility provides developers familiar with Ethereum&#8217;s tooling and dApps an accessible platform. This simplifies the migration or extension of existing Ethereum applications to BSC, broadening their reach in terms of audience and resources, consequently.</li>
<li><strong>Security and Trust:</strong> opBNB maintains a strong focus on security with its fraud-proving scheme. All off-chain transactions are validated, ensuring an added layer of trust for developers and users. The transparency and verifiability of transactions on opBNB contribute to a safer application environment.</li>
<li><strong>Future-Proof Development:</strong> with its robust and flexible framework, opBNB enables developers to adapt to changes, add new features, and experiment with innovative ideas. <strong>It is not just a solution for the present but also a strategic choice for future development.</strong> In short: BNB launches opBNB Testnet, which is an integral part of the thriving BSC ecosystem, allowing developers and projects to interact with various projects and tokens, including BNB, USDT and future ERC20 tokens supported on opBNB. This integration fosters the growth of diverse applications, from gaming <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/dapp/"><strong>dApps</strong> </a> to social networks, within an efficient and cost-effective blockchain environment.</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Europe takes action to regulate AIs.</strong> On June 14th, the European Parliament approved the Artificial Intelligence Act, the world&#8217;s first law to regulate AI. The approval in parliament, with 499 votes in favor, 28 against, and 93 abstentions, is the first step towards its final endorsement, which will come after going through the Council, where it will be definitively processed.</li>
<li><strong>The aim of the European Union&#8217;s Artificial Intelligence Act is to set limits on AI in areas related to privacy, human rights, and the very existence of human beings.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>The privacy issue</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The law will prohibit the use of artificial intelligence in video surveillance cameras in public spaces, both in real-time and retrospectively. The exception will be if there are serious crimes being investigated by the police, with prior judicial authorization.</li>
<li>The law will also deny the creation of biometric categories based on identity, such as gender, ethnicity, religion, etc. Nor will it allow predictive policing systems based on profiling or criminal records, as well as the use of AI for face recognition in law enforcement, workplaces, or education.</li>
<li>Furthermore, it will not be possible to create databases of individuals using images taken from the internet or closed-circuit television. In the case of generative artificial intelligence models like ChatGPT, DALL-e, Bing with AI, Stable Diffusion, Google Bard, etc., the EU will require them to be registered in a database before being commercialized.</li>
<li>These AI models will have to avoid responses that pose a risk to health, safety, fundamental rights, the environment, democracy, and the rule of law. <strong>All content generated by AI will need to be indicated by the AI itself with a watermark or explanatory text about its origin.</strong></li>
<li>Moreover, these models will have to specify the copyrighted data they have used for their development. In some cases, artificial intelligence may be exempt from these rules, for example, in research projects or open-source AI.</li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2>The bright side of AI and its application in crypto world</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the key areas where AI has made significant contributions to cryptocurrencies is in <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/trading-bot/">trading.</a> AI-powered trading algorithms can analyze market trends, historical data, news sentiment, and social media feeds to make informed decisions about buying, selling, or holding crypto assets. These algorithms can execute trades at speeds and <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/trading-volume/">volumes</a> that surpass human capabilities, leading to increased efficiency and <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/liquidity/">liquidity</a> in the market.</p>
<p>Moreover, AI can assist in fraud detection and prevention within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. By analyzing transactional patterns and identifying suspicious activities, AI algorithms can help detect fraudulent transactions, protecting investors from potential<a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/scam/"> scams</a> and enhancing the overall security of the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>In <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/pairs">DEXTools app</a> itself, users can count on the protection of advanced analytical tools for safer trading, such as GoPlus Security, Hapi, Quick Intel &amp; TokenSniffer. They also have <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/dextscore/">DEXTScore</a> (for rating the quality of tokens), as well as a new <a href="https://info.dextools.io/new-dextools-price-bot-step-by-step-guide-token-pair-trading/">DEXTools Price Bot</a> and New Pairs Bot.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>Another area where AI is revolutionizing cryptocurrencies is in the field of <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/smart-contract/">smart contracts.</a> Smart contracts are self-executing agreements with predefined conditions, and AI can enhance their functionality by automating the verification and execution processes. AI algorithms can assess the conditions and outcomes of smart contracts, ensuring accuracy, transparency, and trust in decentralized <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/defi/">DeFi</a> transactions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants are being deployed in the cryptocurrency industry to provide real-time customer support, answer queries, and facilitate transactions. These chatbots can leverage natural language processing and machine learning techniques to understand and respond to user inquiries, improving user experience and accessibility.</p>
<h2>OpenAI and the AI-based token trend</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OpenAI, the U.S.-based company known for the popular ChatGPT application, has recently introduced a new version of its software: GPT-4, which OpenAI claims is 1,000 times more advanced than previous versions. The main improvement lies in the software&#8217;s search functionality,<strong> which now allows images to be included in addition to text.</strong> The initial release of the original ChatGPT version of OpenAI in November last year caused a significant change in the AI landscape. Consequently, several cryptographic AI tokens have experienced significant price spikes driven by market enthusiasm,<strong> generating something similar to the hype created by the meme season tokens we discussed<a href="https://info.dextools.io/meme-season-the-hype-behind-pepe-token/"> in a previous article.</a></strong></p>
<h3></h3>
<h2>Other use cases</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apart from cryptocurrency trading, the potential technological use cases for AIs are multiple and cover a wide range of areas, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Video games, Online shopping, Rideshare Apps, Navigation Apps, Smart Homes, 3D Photography, Security and Surveillance, Facial Recognition, Media Recommendations, Smart Assistants (like Amazon’s Alexa), Spam Filters, Video Summaries, Online Banking, Autonomous Vehicles… and much more.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2>But&#8230;what are AIs actually?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves the emulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. It encompasses the creation of computer systems or algorithms capable of analyzing, interpreting, learning from data, and making decisions or predictions based on such analysis. AI encompasses diverse subfields such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and more.</p>
<p><strong>AI systems are crafted to perceive their surroundings, comprehend information, reason, make decisions, and even interact with humans in a manner that imitates human intelligence.</strong> They can be trained to identify patterns, adapt to new circumstances, and continually enhance their performance through iterative learning processes.</p>
<h2>Why have Artificial Intelligences become trendy?</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) have ceased to be the plot of a futuristic movie to emerge strongly in the present as a fact full of possibilities, but also full of uncertainty and risks in the face of the new paradigm it brings.</p>
<p>Although there is a lot of talk about Artificial Intelligence applied to the creation of complex images from text as in the case of Dall-e or Midjourney, the possibilities of AI are much more extensive and complex than its mere creative use, which, in the realm of music, for example, could include the legendary musician <strong>Paul McCartney</strong> himself, who has used artificial intelligence (AI) to help create what he calls &#8220;the final Beatles record&#8221;.</p>
<p>He made the announcement on a BBC Radio program, where he detailed that the AI technology had been used to &#8220;pull&#8221; John Lennon&#8217;s voice from an old demo, so he could complete the song.</p>
<p>Anecdotes aside and beyond creativity and art, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful technology that is transforming various industries, and the world of cryptocurrencies is no exception. <strong>AI&#8217;s ability to analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and make accurate predictions has significant implications for the cryptocurrency market.</strong></p>
<h2>The worrying side</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once AIs have entered with force to revolutionize the social and technological landscape, concerns about their possible fraudulent or harmful uses, and about their influence on the labor market and the privacy of individuals, have also skyrocketed. And uncertainty has also grown about how and to what extent AIs will be able to transform the world&#8217;s socioeconomic reality in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>In addition, there is concern that AIs will create a generation and even employment gap among users,</strong> similar to that generated in the past by the emergence of the so-called &#8220;network of networks&#8221;: the Internet itself.</p>
<p>Recently, in an <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/">open letter</a> published in March, 2023 by the Future of Life Institute, <strong>Elon Musk</strong>, Apple co-founder <strong>Steve Wozniak</strong> and a number of other 1000 technology leaders warned that powerful AI systems should only be developed when there is certainty that the effects will be positive and the risks controllable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embed-container">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">More than 1,000 technology leaders and researchers, including Elon Musk, signed an open letter urging a pause in the development of the most powerful artificial intelligence systems, warning that AI tools present “profound risks to society and humanity.” <a href="https://t.co/6lEG5DBqOb">https://t.co/6lEG5DBqOb</a></p>
<p>&mdash; The New York Times (@nytimes) <a href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1641136990753103872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Elon Musk&#8217;s own words: &#8220;I think AI poses a greater risk to society than cars, airplanes or medicine. <strong>We need some kind of regulatory authority or something to oversee development. It&#8217;s a pretty dangerous technology, and I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve done some things myself to accelerate it.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence has also become a popular tool in the world of cryptocurrencies. Its applications in trading, fraud detection, smart contracts, and customer support have revolutionized the industry, making it more efficient, secure, and accessible. <strong>As AI continues to evolve, we can expect further advancements in the field, leading to increased adoption of cryptocurrencies and a more robust ecosystem overall.</strong> However, it is crucial to monitor the ethical implications and potential risks associated with AI integration to ensure its responsible and beneficial use.</p>

<h1>The conflict escalates</h1>
<p>Following the announcement of the SEC lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase that we discussed in this <a href="https://info.dextools.io/know-more-about-sec-crypto-regulation-binance-coinbase/">previous article,</a> <strong>the battle of crypto exchanges against the U.S. regulator intensifies!</strong></p>
<p>On June 12th, Binance.US filed a legal motion requesting the presiding judge to reject the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/what-is-sec-crypto-regulation/">(SEC)</a> request to freeze the exchange&#8217;s assets. Binance stated that the order would significantly affect its business and harm customers. The potential impact on customer funds could hold some weight. The SEC argued that the exchange violated securities laws for years, thereby jeopardizing customer funds, <strong>but the asset freeze could potentially have the same result.</strong></p>
<p>The defense lawyers described the SEC&#8217;s request as &#8220;draconian&#8221;, an adjetive which refers to laws, rules, policies, or actions that exhibit an extreme degree of harshness, severity, or strictness. The term originates from Draco, a historical figure in ancient Athens who became known for implementing an exceptionally rigorous legal code.</p>
<p>There are other reasons why Binance.US will need to bolster its defense. <strong>The exchange&#8217;s market depth has plummeted by 78% since the SEC lawsuit was announced.</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2283 img-fluid" src="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/Change-Market-Depth-300x160.jpg" alt="" width="444" height="237" srcset="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/Change-Market-Depth-300x160.jpg 300w, https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/Change-Market-Depth-768x410.jpg 768w, https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/Change-Market-Depth.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Market makers have exited Binance Exchange in large numbers, instantly causing a significant decline in market depth.</strong> With insufficient liquidity, the exchange could face a substantial uphill battle to regain its previous position, if it can survive the legal battle against the SEC in the first place.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Solana Foundation has rejected the classification of its token SOL as a security by the SEC. Polygon Labs has also expressed a similar sentiment, stating that they developed and implemented MATIC outside the United States.</p>
<h2>Some latest news:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Binance has hired a former official from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as part of its legal team</strong> to defend against accusations of operating as an unregistered securities exchange. According to a June 12th Bloomberg report, Binance has hired former SEC Co-Director of Enforcement, George Canellos, along with three other attorneys from the international law firm Milbank LLP. Canellos left the SEC in 2014 after serving in various leadership positions for over four years.</li>
<li>U.S. Congressman Warren Davidson introduced the &#8220;SEC Stabilization Act&#8221; in the House of Representatives, announced on June 12th. One of the main provisions of the bill is to dismiss the current Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler. Davidson stated in a press release: &#8220;<strong>The U.S. capital markets must be protected from a tyrannical Chairman, including the current one. That&#8217;s why I will introduce legislation that addresses the current abuse of power and ensures protection that benefits the market in the years to come. It&#8217;s time for real reform and for Gary Gensler to be fired as SEC Chairman.&#8221;</strong></li>
<li>One of the high-profile voices criticizing Gensler this week has been David Sacks, former COO of Pay Pal, who claimed that &#8220;Coinbase has essentially done everything right.&#8221; He asserts that what Gensler and the SEC are saying is that operating a cryptocurrency exchange in the United States is not legal<strong>. Sacks believes that only Congress has the power to impose such broad restrictions.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What does the future hold for cryptocurrencies?</h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2>The controversy</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The SEC crackdown could send crypto businesses overseas. There is certainly evidence suggesting that crypto companies are already turning their backs on the U.S. market. In the span of a week, major exchanges like Robinhood have delisted tokens classified as securities by the SEC<strong>, while the U.S. arm of Binance has been forced to completely suspend USD withdrawals and deposits.</strong> <strong>To make matters worse, outside the United States, politicians are making moves to attract crypto businesses in exile. </strong>For instance, on Saturday the 10<sup>th</sup> Hong Kong Legislative Council member Johnny Ng has extended an invitation to Coinbase and other crypto exchanges to set up operations in Hong Kong, offering assistance in the application process for official trading platforms and further development plans.</li>
<li>But, while Coinbase is undoubtedly an attractive target for Hong Kong&#8217;s crypto hub ambitions, it seems likely that the American company will continue to fight on the domestic front. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong expressed his disappointment with the SEC &#8220;enforcement-first&#8221; approach over the past year. &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel like there&#8217;s a clear playbook. The only high-level statement they&#8217;ve made is that everything that&#8217;s not Bitcoin is a security,&#8221; he commented. <strong>He added that if all crypto assets except Bitcoin are deemed securities, it would mean the end of the cryptocurrency industry in the United States.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<h2>The consequences</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In related news, Bitcoin and ether reserves on U.S.-based crypto exchanges have dropped below 50% due to the ongoing regulatory crackdown in the country.</strong> According to a research report by CryptoQuant, U.S.-based exchanges have been surpassed by offshore/international exchanges in terms of the amount of bitcoin they hold for their customers. The report also highlights that the bitcoin reserves held by U.S.-based exchanges are at their lowest level since January 2017. <strong>Crypto reserves represent the coins and tokens held by exchanges on behalf of users, and the decline in reserves suggests that users are withdrawing their funds from exchanges,</strong> possibly due to security concerns or to store their assets in private wallets.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Summarizing:</strong> The regulatory crackdown by U.S. authorities has prompted international exchanges to gain traction. The SEC recently sued both Binance and Coinbase for allegedly violating securities regulations. Meanwhile, regions like Hong Kong have adopted crypto-friendly policies, attracting more crypto firms and users. The U.S. federal government and regulators have made it increasingly challenging for U.S.-based crypto businesses, leading some exchanges to cease operations in the country or establish platforms outside the U.S. In fact, a Hong Kong lawmaker openly invited Coinbase to move to an Asian city.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Given the regulatory and political pressure, what can ordinary users do for themselves?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key to safe crypto trading in a context of regulatory pressure is to resort to decentralized exchanges <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/dex/">(DEXs). </a>Or simply trade outside of any exchange, using specialized trading <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/dapp/">DApps</a> such as <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/dextools/">DEXTools.</a> In any case, to ensure anonymity it is best to avoid platforms with KYC, which is also not without other risks. Let&#8217;s take a look.</p>
<h2>What does KYC mean and what are the pros and cons of avoiding it?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/kyc/">KYC</a> stands for Know Your Customer. It is a process implemented by entities and companies that provide financial services, aiming to comply with various laws to prevent <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/what-is-aml/">money laundering</a> and other illicit activities. The KYC process is part of the registration or onboarding process. To pass it successfully, customers are required to provide identification documents and personal information such as their name, date of birth, nationality, etc. In some cases, additional information like tax residency may be requested.</li>
<li>At first, companies that offer crypto services, known as VASP (Virtual Asset Service Providers), are also obligated to comply with KYC requirements. <strong>However, there are exchanges that do not enforce KYC for their customers or only apply it for certain operations.</strong> The location of the company and the nature of its operations play a role. <strong>Authorities in a country with lenient regulations regarding the use of cryptocurrencies may not prioritize user identification, especially when fiat money is not involved.</strong></li>
<li>In fact, many KYC-free platforms only allow crypto transactions. In certain jurisdictions, KYC is mandatory. <strong>The European Union serves as a clear example of authorities striving to control every movement of capital, whether in the form of crypto or fiat.</strong> The official argument for such measures is to prevent tax evasion and the funding of criminal activities, even though the privacy and freedom of citizens may be compromised.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is legitimate for individuals to desire anonymity. <strong>Assuming that a user intends to engage in illegal activities is something that bothers a significant portion of the crypto community.</strong> While they understand some of the the measures taken by politicians, they prefer managing their finances without any organization or group of hackers being able to identify them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2367 img-fluid" src="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/KYC_-1-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/KYC_-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/KYC_-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/KYC_-1.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why trade on a cryptocurrency exchange without KYC?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The main reason to buy and sell cryptocurrencies on a platform without KYC is privacy. Trading on an exchange without verification reduces the likelihood of personal information falling into the wrong hands. In addition to anonymity, these platforms often offer global services, allowing users to trade from virtually anywhere in the world. <strong>KYC-free exchanges democratize access to the market, particularly by removing barriers for users in &#8220;irregular&#8221; situations,</strong> such as the unbanked, individuals without identity documents, or those without a fixed residence<strong>. </strong></li>
<li>Furthermore, they enable transactions in situations where anonymity is imperative, not due to illicit reasons, but for personal security. <strong>However, it is important to note that there are risks associated with KYC-free platforms, including <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/scam/">scams</a> and <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/hacking/">hacks</a>.</strong> Therefore, is essential conducting thorough research before depositing a significant amount of capital into an exchange, especially a decentralized exchange (DEX).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t forget this: DYOR (Do Your Own Research) is crucial for personal crypto security!  </strong><strong><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2356 img-fluid alignnone" src="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/lupa1-300x300.png" alt="" width="43" height="43" srcset="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/lupa1-300x300.png 300w, https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/lupa1-150x150.png 150w, https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/lupa1.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 43px) 100vw, 43px" /></strong></p>
<p>Next, we will see some of the best exchanges without KYC, or with a minimum KYC reserved only for specific operations, with which to trade securely with crypto assets while maintaining a high degree of anonymity.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: Weighing Privacy Risks and Benefits</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No-KYC exchanges provide a high level of privacy and accessibility for users seeking anonymity in their cryptocurrency transactions. However, risks such as <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/scam/">scams</a> and <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/hacking/">hacking</a> exist, emphasizing the importance of thorough research before depositing significant capital, especially in decentralized exchanges (<a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/dex/">DEXs</a>). Users should carefully consider the trade-off between privacy and security when choosing an exchange that aligns with their preferences and needs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>New Uniswap release: Uniswap V4</h1>
<p>Today, Uniswap announced Uniswap v4, presenting a significant leap forward in their platform! New features include <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/limit-order/">limit orders</a>, auto-compounding, Dynamic Fees and TWAMM (Time-Weighted <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/automated-market-maker-amm/">Automated Market Maker</a>)</p>
<p>Uniswap Labs has released a preliminary version of the code for Uniswap V4. <strong>This latest iteration introduces &#8220;hooks&#8221; or plugins that empower developers to construct personalized <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/liquidity-pool/">liquidity pools.</a> </strong>Uniswap, as the world&#8217;s largest decentralized cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/dex/">(DEX)</a> in terms of volume, had previously launched its V3 version on May 2021, and it has been successfully deployed its BNB Chain support on March 2023.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is Uniswap?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uniswap is a growing network of <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/defi/">DeFi</a> apps. It is a well-known decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol developed on the Ethereum blockchain at its origin, which operates as an Automated Market Maker (AMM) that enables direct token trading from users&#8217; wallets, eliminating the need for intermediaries.</p>
<p>The protocol&#8217;s foundation relies on <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/liquidity-pool/">liquidity pools,</a> a simple and elegant concept utilized by Uniswap for facilitating token swaps. Liquidity providers contribute token pairs, such as <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/ether-eth/">ETH</a> and an <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/erc-20/">ERC-20</a> token to these pools, and receive liquidity pool tokens representing their share of the pool.</p>
<p><strong>Uniswap&#8217;s innovative approach disrupts traditional order book systems by utilizing liquidity pools instead.</strong> By employing mathematical formulas, particularly the constant product formula, Uniswap determines token prices and executes trades. This formula ensures that the product of token quantities in a pool remains constant. Consequently, when one token is bought, its price increases while the price of the other token decreases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>New Features on Uniswap V4</strong></h2>
<h2></h2>
<p><strong>Hooks</strong></p>
<p>A standout change in V4 is the introduction of hooks, a remarkable innovation. These hooks serve as plugins that facilitate the creation of highly adaptable pools. They open up possibilities for incorporating new functionalities into Uniswap, such as dynamic fees, limit orders, TWAP orders, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Singleton</strong></p>
<p>Another notable addition to V4 is the singleton, which plays a pivotal role. Acting as a single contract housing all the pools deployed on V4, the singleton streamlines trades by significantly reducing gas costs associated with swaps and pool deployment.</p>
<p><strong>Governance</strong></p>
<p>Similar to V3, V4 will operate under the governance of the Uniswap <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/dao/">DAO</a>. Additionally, it will feature a protocol-fee switch that UNI token holders can activate on a per-pool basis.</p>
<p>V4 version will enable Uniswap to become a more versatile and adaptable protocol. Developers will have the ability to create hooks and seamlessly build upon Uniswap&#8217;s liquidity infrastructure compared to V3. This shift could usher in a new era of creativity and innovation within the realm of decentralized finance <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/defi/">(DeFi</a>).</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>What is this update really about?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uniswap V4 aims to facilitate the inclusion of code that executes specific actions at crucial stages of a pool&#8217;s lifecycle. These actions can be performed before or after a swap, or before or after a change in LP (Liquidity Provider) positions. An example of this is the ability for deployers to create time-weighted average market makers (TWAMMs), enabling users to sell large amounts of cryptocurrency in smaller batches over time. This feature can help traders avoid being front-run by <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine/">EVM</a> (Ethereum Virtual Machine) bots or experiencing unfavorable price movements. <strong>Furthermore, the updated version of Uniswap will allow for on-chain limit orders, where pools can incorporate logic to fulfill an order only when a token reaches a specific price.</strong></p>
<p>Additional examples of these &#8220;hooks&#8221; include the ability to reinvest fees back into an LP&#8217;s pool or lend out inventory when a particular pool is not in use.</p>
<p><strong>Uniswap V4&#8217;s increased customizability empowers automated market maker (<a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/automated-market-maker-amm/">AMM</a>) exchanges to develop more rapidly by enabling developers to build projects with hook contracts on top of Uniswap&#8217;s security and liquidity.</strong> This customization is expected to expedite and simplify innovation across many projects.</p>

<h1>SEC makes its move</h1>
<p>On June 5, 2023, the SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission), filed a complaint against<a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/binance/"> Binance</a> for allegedly offering unregistered securities. Just one day after filing the lawsuit, the commission also went after <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/1049/">Coinbase</a>!</p>
<p><strong>BNB&#8217;s <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/bnb/">(BNB)</a> market capitalization has fallen by more than $7 billion since June 5, when the SEC sued Binance. The impact of the lawsuit on Binance has been strong, with BNB down nearly 15% so far this week. And for its part, the <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (</a>BTC) price fell from USD 26,800 to USD 25,750 after the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit. <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/ether-eth/">ETH</a> has also been affected!<br />
</strong></p>
<p>These recent actions taken by the <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/sec/">SEC</a> against two major cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance and Coinbase, have elicited mixed responses among cryptocurrency industry professionals and also an obvious concern in the crypto community itself.</p>
<p>Coinciding with the recent SEC lawsuit in the US, this very Friday June 9, the EU legislation on cryptoasset markets (MiCA) was published in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU). This triggers the countdown for the law to come into force as of December 30, 2024. Regulatory pressure on the crypto ecosystem increases worldwide&#8230;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s delve into the SEC&#8217;s demands, the crypto sector&#8217;s reactions and the possible consequences of these regulatory measures on crypto world and <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/defi/">DeFi</a> ecosystem particularly.</p>

<h1>What is the lawsuit about?</h1>
<h1></h1>
<ul>
<li>While some criticize the regulator&#8217;s approach head-on, others call for dialogue and clearer regulations. These developments may have far-reaching consequences, including the relocation of operators to more favorable jurisdictions and a potential erosion of consumer confidence in cryptocurrencies within the United States and abroad<strong>. The industry&#8217;s ongoing efforts to navigate this evolving regulatory landscape will determine the future of the crypto ecosystem as a whole.</strong></li>
<li>While the case against Binance focuses on its executives, the SEC&#8217;s focus on Coinbase lies on its operating practices, without specific allegations of favoring individual interests. However, the 101-page SEC document accuses Coinbase of operating illegally without being registered with the regulator, similar to the lawsuit filed against Binance. The SEC argues that tokens such as Cardano, Solana or Polygon should have been registered as financial assets/securities. In fact, there are already an estimated 67 cryptocurrencies that the U.S. securities regulator has accused of being a &#8220;security&#8221;. Following the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit, ten U.S. states, including California, New Jersey and Washington, have initiated orders to block Coinbase.<br />
<h2>Clashing points of view</h2>
</li>
<li><strong>SEC Chairman Gary Gensler claims that Coinbase has illegally sold financial products, leaving customers with fewer protections</strong>. The company&#8217;s alleged failures include a lack of regulatory registration, which (in theory) ensures that financial services users are protected from fraud and tampering.</li>
<li>On the other hand, Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, criticizes the SEC&#8217;s approach as unacceptable. Smith believes the SEC&#8217;s anti-cryptocurrency stance distracts from substantive policy efforts and bypasses formal rulemaking processes. David Schwed, COO at blockchain security firm Halborn, <strong>emphasizes that the SEC&#8217;s mandate to protect investors can be achieved through clear regulations rather than coercive measures.</strong></li>
<li>For his part, Paolo Ardoino, CTO of <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/tether/">Tether</a>, suggests that the SEC should listen to companies&#8217; complaints. He highlights the growing uncertainty around regulation and guidelines in the U.S., even among the most die-hard cryptocurrency supporters.</li>
<li>Anecdotally, and to put some ironic humor into this tense issue, several memecoins with images inspired by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its chairman, Gary Gensler, have experienced a sharp rise in price following the regulator&#8217;s lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance.</li>

<h1>The impact of regulation on DeFi Ecosystem</h1>
<p>Regulation and centralization have historically gone hand in hand, both in the crypto ecosystem and beyond.  That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to ask this: how does regulation affect decentralized finance (DeFi)?</p>
<h2>1-A brief history:</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies have emerged as a disruptive force in the financial landscape, with decentralized finance <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/defi/">(DeFi)</a> platforms enabling innovative market applications and<a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/dapp/"> DApps.</a> However, this rapid growth has led regulators to assess the need for greater control and oversight of cryptocurrency trading, with the aim of establishing legal frameworks that (in theory) ensure consumer protection, prevent fraud and mitigate systemic risks.</p>
<p>Governments around the world face the challenge of finding a balance between encouraging innovation and safeguarding financial stability. <strong>And, in terms of crypto innovation, DeFi is the undisputed leader, supported by valuable resources such as<a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/dextools/"> DEXTools</a> and its powerful <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/pairs">trading app</a> at the forefront.</strong></p>
<h2>2-what are the main challenges generated by regulation, then?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of regulatory clarity:</strong> it hampers the DeFi ecosystem&#8217;s growth potential. Uncertainty surrounding compliance requirements and legal obligations can deter institutional investors and limit mainstream adoption of DeFi platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance Burden:</strong> stringent regulations can impose substantial compliance burdens on DeFi projects. Compliance costs, such as obtaining licenses and meeting reporting obligations, may also hinder the agility and efficiency of DeFi protocols.</li>
<li><strong>Market Volatility:</strong> regulatory actions can trigger market volatility, causing significant price fluctuations in cryptocurrencies. Investors may become hesitant to engage with DeFi platforms due to increased regulatory scrutiny and uncertainty.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Regulation VS crypto-autonomy. By DEXTools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>But&#8230; who is right in this complex disagreement?</h1>
<p>Well, let&#8217;s take a look at the points of view of both parties.</p>
<h2>1-SEC&#8217;s Perspective:</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC, as the primary regulator in the United States, has expressed concerns over potential securities violations within the crypto space. The agency aims to protect investors and ensure fair and efficient markets. The SEC&#8217;s viewpoints on cryptocurrency regulation include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investor Protection:</strong> it emphasizes the need for robust investor protection measures, such as mandatory disclosure requirements, <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/kyc/">KYC</a> (Know Your Customer) procedures, and anti-money laundering <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/aml/">(AML)</a> safeguards.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Oversight:</strong> the SEC advocates for extending its regulatory oversight to encompass DeFi platforms and decentralized exchanges (<a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/dex/">DEXs</a>). The agency believes that certain DeFi tokens may qualify as securities and should be subject to registration and compliance obligations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2-Perspective of Crypto/DeFi Users :</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decentralization and Privacy:</strong> crypto users often prioritize decentralization and privacy. They argue that excessive regulation could undermine the fundamental principles of DeFi, restricting individual freedoms and impeding innovation.</li>
<li><strong>Self-regulation:</strong> some crypto-users advocate self-regulation within DeFi ecosystem. <strong>They propose the development of industry best practices, but in an autonomous manner.</strong> Establishing codes of conduct and self-governance mechanisms to ensure transparency, security and fair market practices.</li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency regulation significantly impacts the DeFi ecosystem. <strong>While regulatory clarity is essential, excessive regulation may stifle innovation and limit market growth.</strong> Striking a balance that protects investors while fostering innovation remains a key goal.</p>
<p>It is crucial that institutional regulators and cryptocurrency users engage in a constructive dialogue, to develop a flexible regulatory framework that promotes the sustainable growth of DeFi, while safeguarding its autonomous system and (simultaneously) protecting users from potential risks. This is a very difficult balance to strike, which poses a real challenge for the future.</p>

<h2>But, what are stablecoins, exactly?</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take an in-depth look at stable crypto assets and all that they entail.</p>
<p><strong>Stablecoins are blockchain-based tokens whose value is tied to an external asset, such as national currencies or precious metals.</strong> They function as digital representations of the dollar, euro, and even gold. In other words, they are collateralized assets that can be bought and sold within the crypto market.</p>
<p><strong>Stablecoins were created as a solution to the intrinsic volatility of native cryptocurrencies.</strong> While assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum attract users with their various economic benefits, their unpredictable price fluctuations also intimidate potential newcomers.</p>
<p>For instance, when settling a BTC transaction, the value of the currency can be significantly higher or lower than at the time of initiating the transfer, making it challenging to use as a reliable asset.</p>
<p>On the other hand, stablecoin prices tend to vary very little or almost not at all. Stablecoins are a specific type of cryptocurrency designed to minimize price volatility by linking their value to a stable asset, such as a fiat currency or a commodity. Designed to closely track the value of the national currency they emulate, they maintain a price with minimal daily fluctuations, similar to assets like the dollar or the euro. They also have the ability to mimic cryptocurrency features like fast settlement, global transfers, and in some cases, the elimination of intermediaries. As a result, stablecoins have become valuable tools for preserving wealth in highly volatile markets.</p>
<p><strong>Some stablecoins (like DAI) are widely used as collateral in loans and other financial services that have gained popularity in the <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/defi/">DeFi</a> (Decentralized Finance) niche,</strong> <strong>because they have become a key tool for driving decentralized applications (<a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/dapp/">DApps</a>).</strong></p>
<h2>A brief history</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The origins of stablecoins can be traced back nine years ago, when the first proposals to create stable-priced digital assets emerged. The idea was to provide a payment instrument that would reduce the risks associated with cryptocurrency volatility while offering low operational costs and privacy.</p>
<p>In mid-2014, initiatives such as BitUSD and NuBits were introduced. Around the same time, the launch of one of the most popular stablecoins today, <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/tether/">Tether</a> (then known as Realcoin), was being developed, and was officially issued at the end of 2014 on the Bitcoin Omni Layer sidechain.</p>
<p>Other notable stablecoins like DAI entered the market in 2017. DAI, launched on the Ethereum network, operates with smart contracts that use <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/ether-eth/">ETH</a> as collateral and replicate the price of the US dollar.</p>
<h2>How do stablecoins work?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stablecoins are tokens issued on multiple blockchain networks and sidechains, and their behavior depends largely on the blockchain to which they belong.</strong></p>
<p>For example, stablecoins launched on Ethereum have their own smart contracts known as<a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/erc-20/"> ERC-20</a> tokens. All stablecoin transactions within the network are recorded in the public ledger, similar to transactions with native coins like Bitcoin or Ether. However, unlike these, <strong>stablecoins do not have their own <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/blockchain/">blockchain.</a></strong></p>
<p>Stablecoins depend on a provider, company, or governance system, which determines how many tokens are issued, what units they are linked to, and how their reserves are backed. In other words, these entities play a significant role in the stablecoin economy.</p>
<h2>Stablecoins VS CBDCs</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although they may have certain similarities, stablecoins and <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/cbdcs/">CBDCs</a> are different. Stablecoins are privately issued digital currencies backed by assets, aiming to maintain a stable value. CBDCs, on the other hand, are digital currencies issued and regulated by central banks, backed by their credibility. <strong>Stablecoins focus on efficient transactions and cross-border use, while CBDCs aim to enhance the existing monetary system</strong> and provide digital alternatives to traditional cash.</p>
<h2>Types of stablecoins and their use Cases</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stablecoins can be categorized into four general types based on how they are pegged to the value of other assets.</p>
<p><strong>1-Fiat-Backed Stablecoins</strong></p>
<p>They are the most popular type in the market. They are directly <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/pegged-currency/">pegged</a> to a national currency at a ratio of 1:1. For example, each token issued represents one US dollar, euro, or yen. Users deposit fiat currency into a bank account and receive these tokens in return.</p>
<p>These stablecoins typically have a <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/fiat/">fiat</a> guarantee, which means that the stablecoin provider is responsible for maintaining a reserve of fiat currency proportional to the tokens in circulation.</p>
<p><strong>2-Crypto-Backed Stablecoins</strong></p>
<p>The issuance of these assets solely depends on the smart contract that enables their existence, minimizing the need to trust a third party. <strong>In other words: it is programmable money.</strong> They use other crypto assets as collateral, even though the stablecoin reflects the price of a fiat currency. One good example is DAI. Users can deposit ETH or other cryptocurrencies into the MakerDAO contract, the company behind DAI, to guarantee the creation of a new token. <strong>However, the price of the asset will not mimic ETH but rather the US dollar to which it is pegged!</strong></p>
<p>Due to the absence of a company responsible for issuing and managing the asset, these stablecoins often have their own governance systems where users can participate and vote on monetary policies.</p>
<p><strong>3-Commodity-Backed Stablecoins</strong></p>
<p>They are similar to fiat-backed stablecoins, but they are backed by physically reservable tradable assets such as precious metals. Gold is the most commonly used commodity to create these stablecoins, although there are also coins backed by oil, real estate, and other rare metals. Pax Gold (PAXG) is one of the well-known stablecoins in this category.</p>
<p>The provider of the stablecoin owns the tangible asset, which is kept in custody to issue new tokens on the network. Unlike fiat-backed or crypto-backed stablecoins, they can appreciate over time.</p>
<p><strong>4-Algorithmic Stablecoins</strong></p>
<p>They are the least known stablecoins in the market. The value of these coins is not backed by fiat or other cryptocurrencies but rather linked to them through algorithms that mimic their price. One example is Ampleforth (AMPL), an algorithmic stablecoin that adjusts its supply in response to changes in demand. When the price is above the target price, the supply of AMPL tokens increases, and when the price is below the target, the supply decreases. This mechanism aims to maintain a stable value over time.</p>
<h2>Pros and Cons of Stablecoins</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While they offer several benefits, they also have drawbacks. Let&#8217;s explore the advantages and disadvantages of crypto stablecoins:</p>
<h3>Advantages:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stability:</strong> The primary advantage of stablecoins is their ability to provide stability. By pegging their value to a stable asset, they aim to reduce the price volatility commonly associated with other crypto assets. This stability makes stablecoins more suitable for everyday transactions and as a reliable store of value.</li>
<li><strong>Swift Transactions:</strong> Stablecoins enable fast and efficient transactions, often with lower fees compared to traditional banking systems. This makes them valuable for remittances, cross-border payments, and peer-to-peer transactions, ensuring quick and cost-effective transfers of value.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Stablecoins increase access to digital financial services, particularly for individuals in regions with limited banking infrastructure. They enable participation in the global economy even without a traditional bank account, promoting financial inclusion for underserved populations.</li>
<li><strong>Programmability:</strong> Stablecoins built on blockchain platforms can leverage the programmability of smart contracts. This opens up a range of financial applications, <strong>including decentralized finance <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/defi/">(DeFi)</a> protocols</strong>, lending platforms, and automated financial transactions, enhancing the efficiency and flexibility of transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Certain stablecoins offer enhanced privacy features, allowing users to engage in transactions with a certain level of anonymity. While privacy is not a priority for all stablecoins, it can be a beneficial feature for those seeking increased transactional privacy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Centralization and Counterparty Risk:</strong> Many stablecoins rely on centralized entities or custodians to maintain the peg and hold reserves. This introduces counterparty risk, as the stability of the stablecoin depends on the trustworthiness and financial soundness of these entities. If the custodian fails or engages in fraudulent activities, it could jeopardize the value of the stablecoin.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Challenges:</strong> Stablecoins have attracted regulatory scrutiny, particularly those aiming to replicate fiat currencies. Governments and financial institutions are concerned about potential risks associated with money laundering, fraud, and financial stability.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Transparency:</strong> Some stablecoins lack transparency regarding their underlying reserves. Without adequate auditing and public reporting of reserve holdings, users may have doubts about the actual value and stability of the stablecoin, potentially undermining trust in the system.</li>
<li><strong>Price Volatility of Underlying Assets:</strong> Stablecoins pegged to specific commodities, such as gold or oil, may still be vulnerable to the price volatility of those assets. If the underlying asset experiences significant price fluctuations, it can impact the value of the stablecoin, deviating from its intended stability.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability and Network Congestion:</strong> Stablecoins built on certain blockchain platforms, like Ethereum, may encounter scalability issues and network congestion during periods of high transaction volume. This can result in increased transaction fees and slower transaction times, affecting the overall efficiency and user experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Some valuable examples of stablecoins to keep in mind</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tether (USDT):</strong> It is one of the main stablecoins in terms of market capitalization. It is backed by dollars, with its reserves physically held in bank accounts under the name of Tether Limited. In addition to USDT, Tether Limited is also responsible for issuing stablecoins anchored to the euro. Tether has faced scrutiny regarding the management of its dollar reserves. The lack of specific information about the assets and banks involved raised concerns. Nevertheless, Tether USDT remains one of the most widely capitalized stablecoins.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>True USD (TUSD):</strong> It is another physically backed stablecoin tied to the US dollar. The token was launched in 2018 on the Ethereum blockchain, using an ERC-20 contract as its foundation. Although True USD is the token issuer, the stablecoin&#8217;s reserves are held by a group of accredited financial institutions. True USD is obligated to publish the contents of its bank accounts regularly and undergo monthly audits conducted by third parties.</li>
<li><strong>Pax Gold (PAXG):</strong> Is backed by gold, making it one of the few stablecoins collateralized by commodities. According to Paxos specifications, each PAXG token represents one troy ounce of a London Good Delivery gold bar. These bars, each containing 400 ounces, are stored in Brink&#8217;s vaults under the name of Paxos Trust Company.</li>
<li><strong>Dai (DAI):</strong> Developed by the MakerDAO initiative, DAI is one of the most widely used asset-backed stablecoins on the Ethereum network. <strong>Unlike Tether, it operates in a decentralized manner with its own governance system,</strong> regulated by its smart contract. DAI does not have physical reserves to back its issuance. Instead, users guarantee the minting of new tokens by depositing Ether (ETH) or other cryptographic assets into the MakerDAO smart contract. In return for the deposited cryptocurrencies, they receive a token that maintains a 1:1 parity with the US dollar. DAI plays a significant role in shaping the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem: it serves as a widely utilized asset in lending platforms and decentralized exchanges (DEX).</li>
<li><strong><strong>Binance USD (BUSD):</strong></strong>Thanks to Paxos Standard and Binance, it has been ranked as the third-largest stablecoin by market cap. The BUSD stablecoin maintains a peg of 1:1 with US dollars, which implies that each BUSD is traded for $1 from the reserves. BUSD is a fiat-collateralized stablecoin. Paxos burns your BUSD when you submit it to them, then sends you their fiat substitute.</li>
<li><strong>USD Coin (USDC): </strong>This stablecoin has a 1:1 value correlation with the US dollar. It is accessible on several blockchains, including Ethereum, Algorand, BNB Smart Chain, Solana, Polygon, and Tron, and it provides liquidity to the cryptocurrency markets. In essence, USDC is an ERC20 utility token, which is a protocol for creating smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.</li>
<li><strong>USB:</strong> This stablecoin is backed by Bitcoin and is specifically designed to mirror the value of the US Dollar using a unique approach: shorting Bitcoin! By doing so, it eliminates the necessity for traditional bank accounts, providing protection against crackdowns or frozen funds, and enhancing privacy and resilience. You can learn more about USB project <a href="https://stabolut.com/">here.</a></li>

<h3><strong>DEXTools has just integrated the PulseChain network!</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PulseChain has launched its <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/mainnet/">mainnet</a>, offering users and developers the opportunity to engage with assets and applications on this innovative network with lower fees than in <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>. The official PulseChain Bridge facilitates the transfer of <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/ether-eth/">ETH</a> from Ethereum to the PulseChain mainnet, enabling users to leverage DeFi and other applications on this new Layer 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What is Pulse Chain?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PulseChain is a blockchain network created as an alternative to Ethereum, founded by Richard Heart, the creator of HEX cryptocurrency. It aims to address scalability and high gas fee issues by offering a faster, more efficient, and cost-effective platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and transactions. <strong>PulseChain plans to launch with a complete copy of the Ethereum state, allowing users to have mirrored versions of their Ethereum tokens on the new chain, and enabling interaction without affecting their Ethereum-based assets.</strong> PulseChain employs a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, emphasizing its commitment to environmentally friendly operations.</p>
<p>In summary, PulseChain provides a promising solution to Ethereum&#8217;s scalability and high<a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/gas-fee/"> gas fee</a> challenges, delivering a more efficient and cost-effective platform for dApps and transactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>How to bridge to Pulse Chain.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://bridge.pulsechain.com/#/bridge">You can bridge to PulseChain here,</a> following these four steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Visit the PulseChain Bridge and connect your MetaMask Wallet.</li>
<li>Connect to the Ethereum network and prepare the ETH you want to transfer.</li>
<li>Specify the amount of ETH you wish to send from Ethereum to PulseChain on the bridge app.</li>
<li>Review the transaction details and complete the process. Your ETH will be bridged within two minutes.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fees associated with bridging to PulseChain primarily consist of gas costs for cross-chain asset transfers. These fees vary depending on the originating network and are generally below $1, except for transfers from the Ethereum mainnet, which may range from $5 to $10. PulseChain does not impose any additional charges.</p>

<p>In its exponential technological growth in functionalities for <a href="https://info.dextools.io/what-is-defi/">DeFi trading</a>, DEXTools offers users (as of today) more than 70 blockchains available and easily accessible through its handy App. We list here the top 10 in the ranking, according to the number of users:</p>
<p><strong>1-Ethereum (ETH). </strong>It is a decentralized, open-source platform that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. It also has its own cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), which is used to pay for transaction fees and computational services on the network.</p>
<p><strong>2-Binance (BNB). </strong>It is currently the world&#8217;s biggest crypto exchange in terms of trading volume, and it provides a variety of crypto trading pairs and services like spot trading, margin trading, futures trading, and staking. It has its own token (BNB), which can be utilized for various purposes, such as covering trading fees and other services on the Binance platform.</p>
<p><strong>3-Arbitrum (ARB). </strong>It is a solution developed to address the scalability issues of the Ethereum blockchain. It operates as a layer 2 scaling solution, which enables developers to construct decentralized applications (dApps) that are more efficient and less expensive to operate.</p>
<p><strong>4-Solana (SOL).</strong> It is a blockchain network for high-frequency trading and decentralized applications (DApps) that is quick, safe, and censorship-resistant. Proof of History (PoH), a unique consensus technique used by Solana, enables validators to handle transactions in parallel without having to wait for confirmation.</p>
<p><strong>5-Dogecoin (DOGE).</strong> Originally, Dogecoin was created as a humorous cryptocurrency inspired by the Doge meme. Transactions on the Dogecoin blockchain are validated by a network of nodes in a decentralized manner. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin&#8217;s supply is not limited, which means there is no cap on the number of Dogecoins that can be created.</p>
<p><strong>6-Polygon (MATIC).</strong> It enhances Ethereum&#8217;s scalability as a Layer 2 scaling solution. It is a sidechain that operates alongside the Ethereum mainnet, providing faster and more cost-effective transactions with higher throughput. To achieve its scaling objectives, Polygon enable transactions to be conducted off-chain and then securely settled on the Ethereum mainnet, leading to lower congestion and gas fees.</p>
<p><strong>7-Fantom (FTM).</strong> This blockchain platform is constructed in order to deliver rapid transaction speeds and excellent scalability. Its goal is to facilitate the creation of secure, interoperable, and cost-effective decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts.</p>
<p><strong>8-Avalanche (AVAX).</strong> It is a blockchain network that intends to provide quick transaction speeds, low transaction costs, and high scalability. The goal of this platform is to enable secure, interoperable, and customizable dApps and smart contracts. It provides resources for developers, including a developer suite, APIs, and compatibility with other blockchains.</p>
<p><strong>9-Aptos (APT).</strong> It is a blockchain platform that operates using a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. The platform employs the Move programming language for its smart contracts, which is highly flexible and prioritizes safety. It also emphasizes horizontal scaling, which helps alleviate network congestion as it grows.</p>
<p><strong>10-Cronos (CRO).</strong> This blockchain operates using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to support decentralized applications (dApps). Its primary aim is to offer developers a scalable and cost-effective solution for building and deploying dApps on the Cosmos network, without the need to abandon their Ethereum-based assets.</p>

<p id="8b9a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph tw tx sp kk b ty tz gt ua ub uc gx ud ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um un uo up uq jk bi" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Since <a href="https://info.dextools.io/what-is-dextools/">DEXTools</a> was launched as a public beta in June 2020, as a test, but also ambitious and exciting project, it was immediately confirmed as the leading <a href="https://info.dextools.io/what-is-defi/">DeFi</a> platform for trading analytics worldwide,</strong> with a vertiginous growth since its origin, and becoming exponential during last years.</p>
<p id="aedc" class="pw-post-body-paragraph tw tx sp kk b ty tz gt ua ub uc gx ud ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um un uo up uq jk bi" data-selectable-paragraph="">Both the large number of different <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/blockchain/">blockchains</a> visible and easily accessible through the application’s own Pair Explorer (there are already more than 70 chains, and growing), and the huge number of traders who benefit from its wide and useful range of information and trading tools from anywhere on the planet (the record is 50 million users per month), have skyrocketed.</p>
<p id="6c2c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph tw tx sp kk b ty tz gt ua ub uc gx ud ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um un uo up uq jk bi" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Its functionality has also been expanded and enhanced, with constant technical improvements on the app</strong> in order to make it more versatile to meet the demands of a growing and more complex saturated crypto market, <strong>but also with the intention of adapting it to the requirements and direct needs of a growing community of loyal users</strong>, who, from the very beginning, have been and are the main support and the greatest asset of DEXTools.</p>
<p id="4289" class="pw-post-body-paragraph tw tx sp kk b ty tz gt ua ub uc gx ud ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um un uo up uq jk bi" data-selectable-paragraph="">The already well-cohesive DEXTools team also forms a close-knit group with those who enjoy the app and, because of that, this contributes to its improvement: alerting of technical bugs and suggesting useful changes in the usability of the platform. Especially through the DEXT Force and main Telegram channels, which are always very active, such feedback explains part of DEXTools’ resounding success, no doubt. But there is much more, actually….</p>

<p id="fe3f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph tw tx sp kk b ty tz gt ua ub uc gx ud ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um un uo up uq jk bi" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Security, power, versatility, innovation and trust are the key words here. Pool Explorer, Pair Explorer, Big Swap Explorer, Multiswap and Wallet Info are the main and powerful tools. </strong>From the DEXTools app, and both in its desktop and mobile version (Android &amp; IOS), you can check live token prices, follow market movements, track favorite <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/pair/">pairs</a> and set useful alarms. The users have plenty of helpful resources at their disposal, such as a useful price and alerts bot and also DEXTscore for the different tokens, which gives the user an idea about their reliability as a guideline to prevent scams. In fact, <strong>security is a vital factor for DEXTools, both for the app itself and for those who benefit daily from its use,</strong> either for free or through the holding of $DEXT token, that extends the advantages.</p>
<p id="97ba" class="pw-post-body-paragraph tw tx sp kk b ty tz gt ua ub uc gx ud ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um un uo up uq jk bi" data-selectable-paragraph="">This last years, as we say, has meant a huge boom for DEXTools, and this despite the obvious current crisis affecting the entire crypto world, in the midst of the bear market. This is parallel to the general crisis of <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/fiat/">fiat money</a> and the stock market, to which the crypto ecosystem itself is no stranger, as it has suffered it on the rebound. Bad credit tokens have fallen, but also other theoretically stable such as UST from Terra/Luna. Even leading companies like FTX or BlockFi have also been affected (sometimes because its bad practices). For its part, the DEXTools native token ($DEXT) has weathered the storm well with some rises even, such as the most recent one in November.<strong> At the beginning of the Project 200 million $DEXT tokens were created,</strong> after burning 50 Million from the team, our deflationary system mechanism with a monthly burn by the team it’s working better than ever so its current circulation is lowering everyday.</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong><a href="https://info.dextools.io/the-biggest-dext-token-burn-in-the-history-of-dextools-by-now/">*Update: Recently in March 2023, DEXTools just burned 3M more tokens</a> (3% of our circulating supply). This is the largest token burn in DeFi&#8217;s history!</strong></p>
<p id="68bd" class="pw-post-body-paragraph tw tx sp kk b ty tz gt ua ub uc gx ud ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um un uo up uq jk bi" data-selectable-paragraph="">Despite the inevitable ups and downs of the market in 2022 and 2023, DEXTools has continued its investment projects through its satellite platform Dext Force Ventures. It has also emphasized its educational and informative work through DEXTools Academy on YouTube. It has participated in public talks and live conferences, but also in various online meetings to raise awareness of the platform and establish ties with the most important players in the crypto ecosystem. In addition, and with an eye on the future, DEXTools has also been involved in broadening the range of its strategic presence in the metaverse, by partnering with ambitious projects such as <a href="https://outerringmmo.com/">Outer Ring,</a> a promising Spanish play-to-earn.</p>
<p id="7166" class="pw-post-body-paragraph tw tx sp kk b ty tz gt ua ub uc gx ud ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um un uo up uq jk bi" data-selectable-paragraph="">Below, we add a basic chronology with some of the innovations in DEXTools, always in a process of growth and improvement. Briefly, without much emphasis on detailing the multitude of new chains, whose work we will deal with in future articles.</p>
