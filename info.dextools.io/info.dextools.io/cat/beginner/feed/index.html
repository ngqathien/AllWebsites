										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Learn how to use our new Price Bot!</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Did you know that DEXTools offers users a new and handy Price Bot?  We explain you how to use this advanced tool in the easiest way and step by step. Let&#8217;s get to it!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1-To get the new DEXTools Price Bot working you need to add it to your group/channel.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Price Bot needs to be admin, and it is preferred that it has access to delete messages. This is only needed to let the bot remove the commands like <strong>/price /p &lt;token/ca&gt;</strong> etc. It will not remove any other messages of course.</p>
<p>This will do the job:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2520 img-fluid" src="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/pb1-1-300x246.jpg" alt="" width="498" height="409" srcset="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/pb1-1-300x246.jpg 300w, https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/pb1-1.jpg 476w" sizes="(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bot has 2 ways of functioning:</p>
<ol>
<li>Respond to <strong>/price</strong> (or <strong>/price &lt;chart number&gt;</strong>) where you as admin setup the pairs it needs to show. This can be handy to show your projects charts!<br />
For example: <strong>/price</strong></li>
<li>Respond to <strong>/p &lt;token name / token contract / pair contract&gt;.</strong><br />
For example:<strong> /p dext</strong><br />
(there are more options to this command which is explained later).</li>
</ol>
<p>To configure the <strong>/price</strong> command you can use the setup menu or type commands. The <strong>/price</strong> command has a maximum of 4 preconfigured charts/price information slots.</p>
<p><strong>     </strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2540 img-fluid" src="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/iconinfo.png" alt="" width="50" height="50" />You can find all the commands if you send a message in private with the bot, send:<strong> /help</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2-To use the new setup menu: as admin, type in the channel where you added the bot:</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>/setpricebot</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A menu will show:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2553 img-fluid" src="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/pb2-300x206.jpg" alt="" width="527" height="362" srcset="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/pb2-300x206.jpg 300w, https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/pb2.jpg 598w" sizes="(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2592 img-fluid" src="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/check-blue.png" alt="" width="50" height="50" />Here you see all 4 slots are empty (not setup yet). Click/tap the first button to set a chart:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2557 img-fluid" src="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/pb3-300x297.jpg" alt="" width="526" height="521" srcset="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/pb3-300x297.jpg 300w, https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/pb3-150x150.jpg 150w, https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/pb3.jpg 603w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2592 img-fluid" src="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/check-blue.png" alt="" width="50" height="50" />You can set the pair which is mandatory. Click/tap on this button:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2566 img-fluid" src="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/pb4-300x154.jpg" alt="" width="524" height="269" srcset="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/pb4-300x154.jpg 300w, https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/pb4.jpg 604w" sizes="(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2592 img-fluid" src="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/check-blue.png" alt="" width="50" height="50" />If you have the DEXTools pair page with your project, you can simply copy the pair and use the button “Type pair”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2569 img-fluid" src="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/pb5-300x129.jpg" alt="" width="521" height="224" srcset="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/pb5-300x129.jpg 300w, https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/pb5.jpg 495w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>If you don’t know the pair, you can use the “Search pair” button. It will ask you to type the token name or contract address and send it.</li>
<li>For example we send “0xfb7b4564402e5500db5bb6d63ae671302777c75a”:</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2574 img-fluid" src="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/pb6-300x287.jpg" alt="" width="521" height="499" srcset="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/pb6-300x287.jpg 300w, https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/pb6.jpg 603w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Follow these steps now:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Choose the pair you want to use by clicking it, or choose “Back to pair menu” to cancel.</li>
<li>If you set a pair you can choose to change the chart type (candles or line), change the format.</li>
<li>You can also set the cooldown period, <strong>this is the period between last requested chart/information where you can do a new request.</strong></li>
<li>There is also the option to change the button text. This is when you have more than 1 pair setup.</li>
<li>Members can use: <strong>/price</strong> and when more than 1 pair is set, a list with buttons with the token names will show. But you can also change the button text.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2540 img-fluid" src="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/iconinfo.png" alt="" width="50" height="50" /> With multiple pairs you can also request directly, like:<strong> /price 3</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2592 img-fluid" src="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/check-blue.png" alt="" width="50" height="50" />You can also choose to show the chart with the message or not.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2592 img-fluid" src="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/check-blue.png" alt="" width="50" height="50" />Lastly, you can choose to delete (reset) the pair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2605 img-fluid" src="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/pb7-284x300.jpg" alt="" width="529" height="559" srcset="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/pb7-284x300.jpg 284w, https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/pb7.jpg 606w" sizes="(max-width: 529px) 100vw, 529px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3-Attention to this new feature!</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the DEXTools pricebot you can request any token/pair! Just use the following command in the channel/group:</p>
<p><strong>/p &lt;token name / contract address&gt;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The pricebot still needs to be an admin in the channel/group and have rights to delete messages.</li>
<li>For example, if you do: <strong>/p dext </strong> you get the information (and chart if possible) of DEXTools. It will use the best result of the term “dext” and show information.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2592 img-fluid" src="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/check-blue.png" alt="" width="50" height="50" />You can also do:</p>
<p><strong>/p dext 2 </strong>&#8212;&gt; This will give the second best result.</p>
<p>And you can do this too :</p>
<p><strong>/p dext new </strong>&#8212;&gt; This will give the newest pair found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2540 img-fluid" src="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/iconinfo.png" alt="" width="50" height="50" /> Remember you can also do: <strong> /p &lt;pair address&gt;</strong> or <strong>/p &lt;token address&gt;</strong></p>
<p>Examples:<br />
/p 0xe91a8d2c584ca93c7405f15c22cdfe53c29896e3<br />
/p 0x72121d60b0e2f01c0fb7fe32ca24021b42165a40</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2540 img-fluid" src="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/iconinfo.png" alt="" width="50" height="50" />  Finally, you can always add the keyword <strong>&#8220;detail&#8221;</strong> at the end of the command to get more detailed information.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>/p 0x72121d60b0e2f01c0fb7fe32ca24021b42165a40 detail<br />
/p dext detail<br />
/p gq new detail</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Europe takes action to regulate AIs.</strong> On June 14th, the European Parliament approved the Artificial Intelligence Act, the world&#8217;s first law to regulate AI. The approval in parliament, with 499 votes in favor, 28 against, and 93 abstentions, is the first step towards its final endorsement, which will come after going through the Council, where it will be definitively processed.</li>
<li><strong>The aim of the European Union&#8217;s Artificial Intelligence Act is to set limits on AI in areas related to privacy, human rights, and the very existence of human beings.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>The privacy issue</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The law will prohibit the use of artificial intelligence in video surveillance cameras in public spaces, both in real-time and retrospectively. The exception will be if there are serious crimes being investigated by the police, with prior judicial authorization.</li>
<li>The law will also deny the creation of biometric categories based on identity, such as gender, ethnicity, religion, etc. Nor will it allow predictive policing systems based on profiling or criminal records, as well as the use of AI for face recognition in law enforcement, workplaces, or education.</li>
<li>Furthermore, it will not be possible to create databases of individuals using images taken from the internet or closed-circuit television. In the case of generative artificial intelligence models like ChatGPT, DALL-e, Bing with AI, Stable Diffusion, Google Bard, etc., the EU will require them to be registered in a database before being commercialized.</li>
<li>These AI models will have to avoid responses that pose a risk to health, safety, fundamental rights, the environment, democracy, and the rule of law. <strong>All content generated by AI will need to be indicated by the AI itself with a watermark or explanatory text about its origin.</strong></li>
<li>Moreover, these models will have to specify the copyrighted data they have used for their development. In some cases, artificial intelligence may be exempt from these rules, for example, in research projects or open-source AI.</li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2>The bright side of AI and its application in crypto world</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the key areas where AI has made significant contributions to cryptocurrencies is in <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/trading-bot/">trading.</a> AI-powered trading algorithms can analyze market trends, historical data, news sentiment, and social media feeds to make informed decisions about buying, selling, or holding crypto assets. These algorithms can execute trades at speeds and <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/trading-volume/">volumes</a> that surpass human capabilities, leading to increased efficiency and <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/liquidity/">liquidity</a> in the market.</p>
<p>Moreover, AI can assist in fraud detection and prevention within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. By analyzing transactional patterns and identifying suspicious activities, AI algorithms can help detect fraudulent transactions, protecting investors from potential<a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/scam/"> scams</a> and enhancing the overall security of the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>In <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/pairs">DEXTools app</a> itself, users can count on the protection of advanced analytical tools for safer trading, such as GoPlus Security, Hapi, Quick Intel &amp; TokenSniffer. They also have <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/dextscore/">DEXTScore</a> (for rating the quality of tokens), as well as a new <a href="https://info.dextools.io/new-dextools-price-bot-step-by-step-guide-token-pair-trading/">DEXTools Price Bot</a> and New Pairs Bot.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>Another area where AI is revolutionizing cryptocurrencies is in the field of <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/smart-contract/">smart contracts.</a> Smart contracts are self-executing agreements with predefined conditions, and AI can enhance their functionality by automating the verification and execution processes. AI algorithms can assess the conditions and outcomes of smart contracts, ensuring accuracy, transparency, and trust in decentralized <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/defi/">DeFi</a> transactions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants are being deployed in the cryptocurrency industry to provide real-time customer support, answer queries, and facilitate transactions. These chatbots can leverage natural language processing and machine learning techniques to understand and respond to user inquiries, improving user experience and accessibility.</p>
<h2>OpenAI and the AI-based token trend</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OpenAI, the U.S.-based company known for the popular ChatGPT application, has recently introduced a new version of its software: GPT-4, which OpenAI claims is 1,000 times more advanced than previous versions. The main improvement lies in the software&#8217;s search functionality,<strong> which now allows images to be included in addition to text.</strong> The initial release of the original ChatGPT version of OpenAI in November last year caused a significant change in the AI landscape. Consequently, several cryptographic AI tokens have experienced significant price spikes driven by market enthusiasm,<strong> generating something similar to the hype created by the meme season tokens we discussed<a href="https://info.dextools.io/meme-season-the-hype-behind-pepe-token/"> in a previous article.</a></strong></p>
<h3></h3>
<h2>Other use cases</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apart from cryptocurrency trading, the potential technological use cases for AIs are multiple and cover a wide range of areas, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Video games, Online shopping, Rideshare Apps, Navigation Apps, Smart Homes, 3D Photography, Security and Surveillance, Facial Recognition, Media Recommendations, Smart Assistants (like Amazon’s Alexa), Spam Filters, Video Summaries, Online Banking, Autonomous Vehicles… and much more.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2>But&#8230;what are AIs actually?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves the emulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. It encompasses the creation of computer systems or algorithms capable of analyzing, interpreting, learning from data, and making decisions or predictions based on such analysis. AI encompasses diverse subfields such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and more.</p>
<p><strong>AI systems are crafted to perceive their surroundings, comprehend information, reason, make decisions, and even interact with humans in a manner that imitates human intelligence.</strong> They can be trained to identify patterns, adapt to new circumstances, and continually enhance their performance through iterative learning processes.</p>
<h2>Why have Artificial Intelligences become trendy?</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) have ceased to be the plot of a futuristic movie to emerge strongly in the present as a fact full of possibilities, but also full of uncertainty and risks in the face of the new paradigm it brings.</p>
<p>Although there is a lot of talk about Artificial Intelligence applied to the creation of complex images from text as in the case of Dall-e or Midjourney, the possibilities of AI are much more extensive and complex than its mere creative use, which, in the realm of music, for example, could include the legendary musician <strong>Paul McCartney</strong> himself, who has used artificial intelligence (AI) to help create what he calls &#8220;the final Beatles record&#8221;.</p>
<p>He made the announcement on a BBC Radio program, where he detailed that the AI technology had been used to &#8220;pull&#8221; John Lennon&#8217;s voice from an old demo, so he could complete the song.</p>
<p>Anecdotes aside and beyond creativity and art, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful technology that is transforming various industries, and the world of cryptocurrencies is no exception. <strong>AI&#8217;s ability to analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and make accurate predictions has significant implications for the cryptocurrency market.</strong></p>
<h2>The worrying side</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once AIs have entered with force to revolutionize the social and technological landscape, concerns about their possible fraudulent or harmful uses, and about their influence on the labor market and the privacy of individuals, have also skyrocketed. And uncertainty has also grown about how and to what extent AIs will be able to transform the world&#8217;s socioeconomic reality in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>In addition, there is concern that AIs will create a generation and even employment gap among users,</strong> similar to that generated in the past by the emergence of the so-called &#8220;network of networks&#8221;: the Internet itself.</p>
<p>Recently, in an <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/">open letter</a> published in March, 2023 by the Future of Life Institute, <strong>Elon Musk</strong>, Apple co-founder <strong>Steve Wozniak</strong> and a number of other 1000 technology leaders warned that powerful AI systems should only be developed when there is certainty that the effects will be positive and the risks controllable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embed-container">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">More than 1,000 technology leaders and researchers, including Elon Musk, signed an open letter urging a pause in the development of the most powerful artificial intelligence systems, warning that AI tools present “profound risks to society and humanity.” <a href="https://t.co/6lEG5DBqOb">https://t.co/6lEG5DBqOb</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Elon Musk&#8217;s own words: &#8220;I think AI poses a greater risk to society than cars, airplanes or medicine. <strong>We need some kind of regulatory authority or something to oversee development. It&#8217;s a pretty dangerous technology, and I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve done some things myself to accelerate it.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence has also become a popular tool in the world of cryptocurrencies. Its applications in trading, fraud detection, smart contracts, and customer support have revolutionized the industry, making it more efficient, secure, and accessible. <strong>As AI continues to evolve, we can expect further advancements in the field, leading to increased adoption of cryptocurrencies and a more robust ecosystem overall.</strong> However, it is crucial to monitor the ethical implications and potential risks associated with AI integration to ensure its responsible and beneficial use.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>The conflict escalates</h1>
<p>Following the announcement of the SEC lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase that we discussed in this <a href="https://info.dextools.io/know-more-about-sec-crypto-regulation-binance-coinbase/">previous article,</a> <strong>the battle of crypto exchanges against the U.S. regulator intensifies!</strong></p>
<p>On June 12th, Binance.US filed a legal motion requesting the presiding judge to reject the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/what-is-sec-crypto-regulation/">(SEC)</a> request to freeze the exchange&#8217;s assets. Binance stated that the order would significantly affect its business and harm customers. The potential impact on customer funds could hold some weight. The SEC argued that the exchange violated securities laws for years, thereby jeopardizing customer funds, <strong>but the asset freeze could potentially have the same result.</strong></p>
<p>The defense lawyers described the SEC&#8217;s request as &#8220;draconian&#8221;, an adjetive which refers to laws, rules, policies, or actions that exhibit an extreme degree of harshness, severity, or strictness. The term originates from Draco, a historical figure in ancient Athens who became known for implementing an exceptionally rigorous legal code.</p>
<p>There are other reasons why Binance.US will need to bolster its defense. <strong>The exchange&#8217;s market depth has plummeted by 78% since the SEC lawsuit was announced.</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2283 img-fluid" src="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/Change-Market-Depth-300x160.jpg" alt="" width="444" height="237" srcset="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/Change-Market-Depth-300x160.jpg 300w, https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/Change-Market-Depth-768x410.jpg 768w, https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/Change-Market-Depth.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Market makers have exited Binance Exchange in large numbers, instantly causing a significant decline in market depth.</strong> With insufficient liquidity, the exchange could face a substantial uphill battle to regain its previous position, if it can survive the legal battle against the SEC in the first place.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Solana Foundation has rejected the classification of its token SOL as a security by the SEC. Polygon Labs has also expressed a similar sentiment, stating that they developed and implemented MATIC outside the United States.</p>
<h2>Some latest news:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Binance has hired a former official from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as part of its legal team</strong> to defend against accusations of operating as an unregistered securities exchange. According to a June 12th Bloomberg report, Binance has hired former SEC Co-Director of Enforcement, George Canellos, along with three other attorneys from the international law firm Milbank LLP. Canellos left the SEC in 2014 after serving in various leadership positions for over four years.</li>
<li>U.S. Congressman Warren Davidson introduced the &#8220;SEC Stabilization Act&#8221; in the House of Representatives, announced on June 12th. One of the main provisions of the bill is to dismiss the current Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler. Davidson stated in a press release: &#8220;<strong>The U.S. capital markets must be protected from a tyrannical Chairman, including the current one. That&#8217;s why I will introduce legislation that addresses the current abuse of power and ensures protection that benefits the market in the years to come. It&#8217;s time for real reform and for Gary Gensler to be fired as SEC Chairman.&#8221;</strong></li>
<li>One of the high-profile voices criticizing Gensler this week has been David Sacks, former COO of Pay Pal, who claimed that &#8220;Coinbase has essentially done everything right.&#8221; He asserts that what Gensler and the SEC are saying is that operating a cryptocurrency exchange in the United States is not legal<strong>. Sacks believes that only Congress has the power to impose such broad restrictions.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What does the future hold for cryptocurrencies?</h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2>The controversy</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The SEC crackdown could send crypto businesses overseas. There is certainly evidence suggesting that crypto companies are already turning their backs on the U.S. market. In the span of a week, major exchanges like Robinhood have delisted tokens classified as securities by the SEC<strong>, while the U.S. arm of Binance has been forced to completely suspend USD withdrawals and deposits.</strong> <strong>To make matters worse, outside the United States, politicians are making moves to attract crypto businesses in exile. </strong>For instance, on Saturday the 10<sup>th</sup> Hong Kong Legislative Council member Johnny Ng has extended an invitation to Coinbase and other crypto exchanges to set up operations in Hong Kong, offering assistance in the application process for official trading platforms and further development plans.</li>
<li>But, while Coinbase is undoubtedly an attractive target for Hong Kong&#8217;s crypto hub ambitions, it seems likely that the American company will continue to fight on the domestic front. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong expressed his disappointment with the SEC &#8220;enforcement-first&#8221; approach over the past year. &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel like there&#8217;s a clear playbook. The only high-level statement they&#8217;ve made is that everything that&#8217;s not Bitcoin is a security,&#8221; he commented. <strong>He added that if all crypto assets except Bitcoin are deemed securities, it would mean the end of the cryptocurrency industry in the United States.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<h2>The consequences</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In related news, Bitcoin and ether reserves on U.S.-based crypto exchanges have dropped below 50% due to the ongoing regulatory crackdown in the country.</strong> According to a research report by CryptoQuant, U.S.-based exchanges have been surpassed by offshore/international exchanges in terms of the amount of bitcoin they hold for their customers. The report also highlights that the bitcoin reserves held by U.S.-based exchanges are at their lowest level since January 2017. <strong>Crypto reserves represent the coins and tokens held by exchanges on behalf of users, and the decline in reserves suggests that users are withdrawing their funds from exchanges,</strong> possibly due to security concerns or to store their assets in private wallets.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Summarizing:</strong> The regulatory crackdown by U.S. authorities has prompted international exchanges to gain traction. The SEC recently sued both Binance and Coinbase for allegedly violating securities regulations. Meanwhile, regions like Hong Kong have adopted crypto-friendly policies, attracting more crypto firms and users. The U.S. federal government and regulators have made it increasingly challenging for U.S.-based crypto businesses, leading some exchanges to cease operations in the country or establish platforms outside the U.S. In fact, a Hong Kong lawmaker openly invited Coinbase to move to an Asian city.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Given the regulatory and political pressure, what can ordinary users do for themselves?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key to safe crypto trading in a context of regulatory pressure is to resort to decentralized exchanges <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/dex/">(DEXs). </a>Or simply trade outside of any exchange, using specialized trading <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/dapp/">DApps</a> such as <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/dextools/">DEXTools.</a> In any case, to ensure anonymity it is best to avoid platforms with KYC, which is also not without other risks. Let&#8217;s take a look.</p>
<h2>What does KYC mean and what are the pros and cons of avoiding it?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/kyc/">KYC</a> stands for Know Your Customer. It is a process implemented by entities and companies that provide financial services, aiming to comply with various laws to prevent <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/what-is-aml/">money laundering</a> and other illicit activities. The KYC process is part of the registration or onboarding process. To pass it successfully, customers are required to provide identification documents and personal information such as their name, date of birth, nationality, etc. In some cases, additional information like tax residency may be requested.</li>
<li>At first, companies that offer crypto services, known as VASP (Virtual Asset Service Providers), are also obligated to comply with KYC requirements. <strong>However, there are exchanges that do not enforce KYC for their customers or only apply it for certain operations.</strong> The location of the company and the nature of its operations play a role. <strong>Authorities in a country with lenient regulations regarding the use of cryptocurrencies may not prioritize user identification, especially when fiat money is not involved.</strong></li>
<li>In fact, many KYC-free platforms only allow crypto transactions. In certain jurisdictions, KYC is mandatory. <strong>The European Union serves as a clear example of authorities striving to control every movement of capital, whether in the form of crypto or fiat.</strong> The official argument for such measures is to prevent tax evasion and the funding of criminal activities, even though the privacy and freedom of citizens may be compromised.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is legitimate for individuals to desire anonymity. <strong>Assuming that a user intends to engage in illegal activities is something that bothers a significant portion of the crypto community.</strong> While they understand some of the the measures taken by politicians, they prefer managing their finances without any organization or group of hackers being able to identify them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2367 img-fluid" src="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/KYC_-1-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/KYC_-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/KYC_-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/KYC_-1.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why trade on a cryptocurrency exchange without KYC?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The main reason to buy and sell cryptocurrencies on a platform without KYC is privacy. Trading on an exchange without verification reduces the likelihood of personal information falling into the wrong hands. In addition to anonymity, these platforms often offer global services, allowing users to trade from virtually anywhere in the world. <strong>KYC-free exchanges democratize access to the market, particularly by removing barriers for users in &#8220;irregular&#8221; situations,</strong> such as the unbanked, individuals without identity documents, or those without a fixed residence<strong>. </strong></li>
<li>Furthermore, they enable transactions in situations where anonymity is imperative, not due to illicit reasons, but for personal security. <strong>However, it is important to note that there are risks associated with KYC-free platforms, including <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/scam/">scams</a> and <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/hacking/">hacks</a>.</strong> Therefore, is essential conducting thorough research before depositing a significant amount of capital into an exchange, especially a decentralized exchange (DEX).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t forget this: DYOR (Do Your Own Research) is crucial for personal crypto security!  </strong><strong><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2356 img-fluid alignnone" src="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/lupa1-300x300.png" alt="" width="43" height="43" srcset="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/lupa1-300x300.png 300w, https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/lupa1-150x150.png 150w, https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/lupa1.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 43px) 100vw, 43px" /></strong></p>
<p>Next, we will see some of the best exchanges without KYC, or with a minimum KYC reserved only for specific operations, with which to trade securely with crypto assets while maintaining a high degree of anonymity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No-KYC exchanges provide a high level of privacy and accessibility for users seeking anonymity in their cryptocurrency transactions. However, risks such as <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/scam/">scams</a> and <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/hacking/">hacking</a> exist, emphasizing the importance of thorough research before depositing significant capital, especially in decentralized exchanges (<a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/dex/">DEXs</a>). Users should carefully consider the trade-off between privacy and security when choosing an exchange that aligns with their preferences and needs.</p>

<h1>SEC makes its move</h1>
<p>On June 5, 2023, the SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission), filed a complaint against<a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/binance/"> Binance</a> for allegedly offering unregistered securities. Just one day after filing the lawsuit, the commission also went after <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/1049/">Coinbase</a>!</p>
<p><strong>BNB&#8217;s <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/bnb/">(BNB)</a> market capitalization has fallen by more than $7 billion since June 5, when the SEC sued Binance. The impact of the lawsuit on Binance has been strong, with BNB down nearly 15% so far this week. And for its part, the <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (</a>BTC) price fell from USD 26,800 to USD 25,750 after the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit. <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/ether-eth/">ETH</a> has also been affected!<br />
</strong></p>
<p>These recent actions taken by the <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/sec/">SEC</a> against two major cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance and Coinbase, have elicited mixed responses among cryptocurrency industry professionals and also an obvious concern in the crypto community itself.</p>
<p>Coinciding with the recent SEC lawsuit in the US, this very Friday June 9, the EU legislation on cryptoasset markets (MiCA) was published in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU). This triggers the countdown for the law to come into force as of December 30, 2024. Regulatory pressure on the crypto ecosystem increases worldwide&#8230;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s delve into the SEC&#8217;s demands, the crypto sector&#8217;s reactions and the possible consequences of these regulatory measures on crypto world and <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/defi/">DeFi</a> ecosystem particularly.</p>

<h1>What is the lawsuit about?</h1>
<h1></h1>
<ul>
<li>While some criticize the regulator&#8217;s approach head-on, others call for dialogue and clearer regulations. These developments may have far-reaching consequences, including the relocation of operators to more favorable jurisdictions and a potential erosion of consumer confidence in cryptocurrencies within the United States and abroad<strong>. The industry&#8217;s ongoing efforts to navigate this evolving regulatory landscape will determine the future of the crypto ecosystem as a whole.</strong></li>
<li>While the case against Binance focuses on its executives, the SEC&#8217;s focus on Coinbase lies on its operating practices, without specific allegations of favoring individual interests. However, the 101-page SEC document accuses Coinbase of operating illegally without being registered with the regulator, similar to the lawsuit filed against Binance. The SEC argues that tokens such as Cardano, Solana or Polygon should have been registered as financial assets/securities. In fact, there are already an estimated 67 cryptocurrencies that the U.S. securities regulator has accused of being a &#8220;security&#8221;. Following the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit, ten U.S. states, including California, New Jersey and Washington, have initiated orders to block Coinbase.<br />
<h2>Clashing points of view</h2>
</li>
<li><strong>SEC Chairman Gary Gensler claims that Coinbase has illegally sold financial products, leaving customers with fewer protections</strong>. The company&#8217;s alleged failures include a lack of regulatory registration, which (in theory) ensures that financial services users are protected from fraud and tampering.</li>
<li>On the other hand, Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, criticizes the SEC&#8217;s approach as unacceptable. Smith believes the SEC&#8217;s anti-cryptocurrency stance distracts from substantive policy efforts and bypasses formal rulemaking processes. David Schwed, COO at blockchain security firm Halborn, <strong>emphasizes that the SEC&#8217;s mandate to protect investors can be achieved through clear regulations rather than coercive measures.</strong></li>
<li>For his part, Paolo Ardoino, CTO of <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/tether/">Tether</a>, suggests that the SEC should listen to companies&#8217; complaints. He highlights the growing uncertainty around regulation and guidelines in the U.S., even among the most die-hard cryptocurrency supporters.</li>
<li>Anecdotally, and to put some ironic humor into this tense issue, several memecoins with images inspired by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its chairman, Gary Gensler, have experienced a sharp rise in price following the regulator&#8217;s lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance.</li>

<h1>The impact of regulation on DeFi Ecosystem</h1>
<p>Regulation and centralization have historically gone hand in hand, both in the crypto ecosystem and beyond.  That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to ask this: how does regulation affect decentralized finance (DeFi)?</p>
<h2>1-A brief history:</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies have emerged as a disruptive force in the financial landscape, with decentralized finance <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/defi/">(DeFi)</a> platforms enabling innovative market applications and<a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/dapp/"> DApps.</a> However, this rapid growth has led regulators to assess the need for greater control and oversight of cryptocurrency trading, with the aim of establishing legal frameworks that (in theory) ensure consumer protection, prevent fraud and mitigate systemic risks.</p>
<p>Governments around the world face the challenge of finding a balance between encouraging innovation and safeguarding financial stability. <strong>And, in terms of crypto innovation, DeFi is the undisputed leader, supported by valuable resources such as<a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/dextools/"> DEXTools</a> and its powerful <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/pairs">trading app</a> at the forefront.</strong></p>
<h2>2-what are the main challenges generated by regulation, then?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of regulatory clarity:</strong> it hampers the DeFi ecosystem&#8217;s growth potential. Uncertainty surrounding compliance requirements and legal obligations can deter institutional investors and limit mainstream adoption of DeFi platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance Burden:</strong> stringent regulations can impose substantial compliance burdens on DeFi projects. Compliance costs, such as obtaining licenses and meeting reporting obligations, may also hinder the agility and efficiency of DeFi protocols.</li>
<li><strong>Market Volatility:</strong> regulatory actions can trigger market volatility, causing significant price fluctuations in cryptocurrencies. Investors may become hesitant to engage with DeFi platforms due to increased regulatory scrutiny and uncertainty.</li>
</ul>

<p>Regulation VS crypto-autonomy. By DEXTools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>But&#8230; who is right in this complex disagreement?</h1>
<p>Well, let&#8217;s take a look at the points of view of both parties.</p>
<h2>1-SEC&#8217;s Perspective:</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC, as the primary regulator in the United States, has expressed concerns over potential securities violations within the crypto space. The agency aims to protect investors and ensure fair and efficient markets. The SEC&#8217;s viewpoints on cryptocurrency regulation include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investor Protection:</strong> it emphasizes the need for robust investor protection measures, such as mandatory disclosure requirements, <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/kyc/">KYC</a> (Know Your Customer) procedures, and anti-money laundering <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/aml/">(AML)</a> safeguards.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Oversight:</strong> the SEC advocates for extending its regulatory oversight to encompass DeFi platforms and decentralized exchanges (<a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/dex/">DEXs</a>). The agency believes that certain DeFi tokens may qualify as securities and should be subject to registration and compliance obligations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2-Perspective of Crypto/DeFi Users :</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decentralization and Privacy:</strong> crypto users often prioritize decentralization and privacy. They argue that excessive regulation could undermine the fundamental principles of DeFi, restricting individual freedoms and impeding innovation.</li>
<li><strong>Self-regulation:</strong> some crypto-users advocate self-regulation within DeFi ecosystem. <strong>They propose the development of industry best practices, but in an autonomous manner.</strong> Establishing codes of conduct and self-governance mechanisms to ensure transparency, security and fair market practices.</li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency regulation significantly impacts the DeFi ecosystem. <strong>While regulatory clarity is essential, excessive regulation may stifle innovation and limit market growth.</strong> Striking a balance that protects investors while fostering innovation remains a key goal.</p>
<p>It is crucial that institutional regulators and cryptocurrency users engage in a constructive dialogue, to develop a flexible regulatory framework that promotes the sustainable growth of DeFi, while safeguarding its autonomous system and (simultaneously) protecting users from potential risks. This is a very difficult balance to strike, which poses a real challenge for the future.</p>

<h2><strong>What are Airdrops?</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Airdrops&#8221; refer to the distribution of free tokens or coins to holders of a specific cryptocurrency or to individuals who meet certain criteria set by a project. This distribution is often carried out as a marketing tactic to increase awareness, foster community engagement, and incentivize adoption of a new token or project.</p>
<p><a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/airdrop/">Airdrops</a> have become an integral part of the crypto ecosystem. They provide a means to distribute<a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/token/"> tokens,</a> build communities, and generate awareness. However, it is important for participants to be aware of the risks associated with airdrops, such as regulatory uncertainties, scams, and token value volatility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2124 img-fluid" src="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/airdrop_-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="398" height="265" srcset="https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/airdrop_-300x200.jpg 300w, https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/airdrop_-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/airdrop_-768x512.jpg 768w, https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/airdrop_-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://info.dextools.io/content/uploads/2023/06/airdrop_.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Risks and Scams Associated with Airdrops:</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regulatory.</strong> The legal and regulatory landscape surrounding airdrops is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Depending on the case, airdrops might be subject to securities regulations, tax liabilities, or other legal considerations. Participants should exercise caution and ensure compliance with applicable laws.</li>
<li><strong>Scams and Fraudulent Projects.</strong> The popularity of airdrops has also attracted scammers seeking to take advantage of unsuspecting individuals. Fake airdrops and fraudulent projects have become common, with scammers seeking to trick users into providing personal information or <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/private-key/">private keys.</a> It is crucial to research and verify the authenticity of a project before participating in an airdrop.</li>
<li><strong>Token Value Volatility.</strong> Airdropped tokens may experience high price volatility immediately after distribution, as participants may quickly sell their tokens for profit. This sudden influx of tokens into the market can lead to a temporary decrease in value. It is important for participants to consider the potential impact on the token&#8217;s value before deciding to hold or sell.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy Concerns.</strong> Some airdrops require participants to provide personal information, which may raise privacy concerns. Participants should carefully evaluate the information they are asked to disclose and ensure that the project has appropriate data protection measures in place.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is common for certain crypto platforms to carry out giveaways or &#8220;airdrops&#8221; in order to increase their user base or retain existing users. This is a good method and is usually done primarily on exchanges. However, not all of these giveaways are always legitimate and they could even be dangerous.</p>
<p>In recent days, <strong>false</strong> <strong>rumors have emerged on CryptoTwitter that the <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/metamask/">MetaMask</a> wallet service is preparing a snapshot or airdrop</strong> among its users. These rumors are accompanied by a platform where users can sign up for the giveaway, which is uncommon since platforms usually directly select eligible participants from among all their users.</p>
<p>Due to these rumors, <strong>the MetaMask administration has decided to debunk any possible misinformation using their official account.</strong></p>
<div class="embed-container">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<h2><strong>Benefits of Airdrops:</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Widening Token Distribution:</strong> airdrops allow projects to distribute their tokens to a large number of participants, helping to increase the circulation and reach of the cryptocurrency. This wider distribution can lead to increased <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/liquidity/">liquidity</a> and<a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/trading-volume/"> trading volume</a>, which may positively impact the token&#8217;s value.</li>
<li><strong>Community Building:</strong> airdrops encourage community participation and engagement by rewarding existing token holders or potential investors. By distributing tokens to interested individuals, projects can foster a supportive and active community, which is crucial for long-term success.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing and Awareness:</strong> airdrops generate buzz and attract attention to a project, increasing its visibility within the crypto space. This can help in creating a strong brand presence, attracting new investors, and facilitating partnerships and collaborations.</li>
<li><strong>User Acquisition:</strong> airdrops serve as an effective method for projects to acquire new users. By offering free tokens, projects can entice individuals to explore their platform, learn about their technology, and potentially become long-term users.</li>
</ul>

<h2>But, what are stablecoins, exactly?</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take an in-depth look at stable crypto assets and all that they entail.</p>
<p><strong>Stablecoins are blockchain-based tokens whose value is tied to an external asset, such as national currencies or precious metals.</strong> They function as digital representations of the dollar, euro, and even gold. In other words, they are collateralized assets that can be bought and sold within the crypto market.</p>
<p><strong>Stablecoins were created as a solution to the intrinsic volatility of native cryptocurrencies.</strong> While assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum attract users with their various economic benefits, their unpredictable price fluctuations also intimidate potential newcomers.</p>
<p>For instance, when settling a BTC transaction, the value of the currency can be significantly higher or lower than at the time of initiating the transfer, making it challenging to use as a reliable asset.</p>
<p>On the other hand, stablecoin prices tend to vary very little or almost not at all. Stablecoins are a specific type of cryptocurrency designed to minimize price volatility by linking their value to a stable asset, such as a fiat currency or a commodity. Designed to closely track the value of the national currency they emulate, they maintain a price with minimal daily fluctuations, similar to assets like the dollar or the euro. They also have the ability to mimic cryptocurrency features like fast settlement, global transfers, and in some cases, the elimination of intermediaries. As a result, stablecoins have become valuable tools for preserving wealth in highly volatile markets.</p>
<p><strong>Some stablecoins (like DAI) are widely used as collateral in loans and other financial services that have gained popularity in the <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/defi/">DeFi</a> (Decentralized Finance) niche,</strong> <strong>because they have become a key tool for driving decentralized applications (<a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/dapp/">DApps</a>).</strong></p>
<h2>A brief history</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The origins of stablecoins can be traced back nine years ago, when the first proposals to create stable-priced digital assets emerged. The idea was to provide a payment instrument that would reduce the risks associated with cryptocurrency volatility while offering low operational costs and privacy.</p>
<p>In mid-2014, initiatives such as BitUSD and NuBits were introduced. Around the same time, the launch of one of the most popular stablecoins today, <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/tether/">Tether</a> (then known as Realcoin), was being developed, and was officially issued at the end of 2014 on the Bitcoin Omni Layer sidechain.</p>
<p>Other notable stablecoins like DAI entered the market in 2017. DAI, launched on the Ethereum network, operates with smart contracts that use <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/ether-eth/">ETH</a> as collateral and replicate the price of the US dollar.</p>
<h2>How do stablecoins work?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stablecoins are tokens issued on multiple blockchain networks and sidechains, and their behavior depends largely on the blockchain to which they belong.</strong></p>
<p>For example, stablecoins launched on Ethereum have their own smart contracts known as<a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/erc-20/"> ERC-20</a> tokens. All stablecoin transactions within the network are recorded in the public ledger, similar to transactions with native coins like Bitcoin or Ether. However, unlike these, <strong>stablecoins do not have their own <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/blockchain/">blockchain.</a></strong></p>
<p>Stablecoins depend on a provider, company, or governance system, which determines how many tokens are issued, what units they are linked to, and how their reserves are backed. In other words, these entities play a significant role in the stablecoin economy.</p>
<h2>Stablecoins VS CBDCs</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although they may have certain similarities, stablecoins and <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/cbdcs/">CBDCs</a> are different. Stablecoins are privately issued digital currencies backed by assets, aiming to maintain a stable value. CBDCs, on the other hand, are digital currencies issued and regulated by central banks, backed by their credibility. <strong>Stablecoins focus on efficient transactions and cross-border use, while CBDCs aim to enhance the existing monetary system</strong> and provide digital alternatives to traditional cash.</p>
<h2>Types of stablecoins and their use Cases</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stablecoins can be categorized into four general types based on how they are pegged to the value of other assets.</p>
<p><strong>1-Fiat-Backed Stablecoins</strong></p>
<p>They are the most popular type in the market. They are directly <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/pegged-currency/">pegged</a> to a national currency at a ratio of 1:1. For example, each token issued represents one US dollar, euro, or yen. Users deposit fiat currency into a bank account and receive these tokens in return.</p>
<p>These stablecoins typically have a <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/fiat/">fiat</a> guarantee, which means that the stablecoin provider is responsible for maintaining a reserve of fiat currency proportional to the tokens in circulation.</p>
<p><strong>2-Crypto-Backed Stablecoins</strong></p>
<p>The issuance of these assets solely depends on the smart contract that enables their existence, minimizing the need to trust a third party. <strong>In other words: it is programmable money.</strong> They use other crypto assets as collateral, even though the stablecoin reflects the price of a fiat currency. One good example is DAI. Users can deposit ETH or other cryptocurrencies into the MakerDAO contract, the company behind DAI, to guarantee the creation of a new token. <strong>However, the price of the asset will not mimic ETH but rather the US dollar to which it is pegged!</strong></p>
<p>Due to the absence of a company responsible for issuing and managing the asset, these stablecoins often have their own governance systems where users can participate and vote on monetary policies.</p>
<p><strong>3-Commodity-Backed Stablecoins</strong></p>
<p>They are similar to fiat-backed stablecoins, but they are backed by physically reservable tradable assets such as precious metals. Gold is the most commonly used commodity to create these stablecoins, although there are also coins backed by oil, real estate, and other rare metals. Pax Gold (PAXG) is one of the well-known stablecoins in this category.</p>
<p>The provider of the stablecoin owns the tangible asset, which is kept in custody to issue new tokens on the network. Unlike fiat-backed or crypto-backed stablecoins, they can appreciate over time.</p>
<p><strong>4-Algorithmic Stablecoins</strong></p>
<p>They are the least known stablecoins in the market. The value of these coins is not backed by fiat or other cryptocurrencies but rather linked to them through algorithms that mimic their price. One example is Ampleforth (AMPL), an algorithmic stablecoin that adjusts its supply in response to changes in demand. When the price is above the target price, the supply of AMPL tokens increases, and when the price is below the target, the supply decreases. This mechanism aims to maintain a stable value over time.</p>
<h2>Pros and Cons of Stablecoins</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While they offer several benefits, they also have drawbacks. Let&#8217;s explore the advantages and disadvantages of crypto stablecoins:</p>
<h3>Advantages:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stability:</strong> The primary advantage of stablecoins is their ability to provide stability. By pegging their value to a stable asset, they aim to reduce the price volatility commonly associated with other crypto assets. This stability makes stablecoins more suitable for everyday transactions and as a reliable store of value.</li>
<li><strong>Swift Transactions:</strong> Stablecoins enable fast and efficient transactions, often with lower fees compared to traditional banking systems. This makes them valuable for remittances, cross-border payments, and peer-to-peer transactions, ensuring quick and cost-effective transfers of value.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Stablecoins increase access to digital financial services, particularly for individuals in regions with limited banking infrastructure. They enable participation in the global economy even without a traditional bank account, promoting financial inclusion for underserved populations.</li>
<li><strong>Programmability:</strong> Stablecoins built on blockchain platforms can leverage the programmability of smart contracts. This opens up a range of financial applications, <strong>including decentralized finance <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/defi/">(DeFi)</a> protocols</strong>, lending platforms, and automated financial transactions, enhancing the efficiency and flexibility of transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Certain stablecoins offer enhanced privacy features, allowing users to engage in transactions with a certain level of anonymity. While privacy is not a priority for all stablecoins, it can be a beneficial feature for those seeking increased transactional privacy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Centralization and Counterparty Risk:</strong> Many stablecoins rely on centralized entities or custodians to maintain the peg and hold reserves. This introduces counterparty risk, as the stability of the stablecoin depends on the trustworthiness and financial soundness of these entities. If the custodian fails or engages in fraudulent activities, it could jeopardize the value of the stablecoin.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Challenges:</strong> Stablecoins have attracted regulatory scrutiny, particularly those aiming to replicate fiat currencies. Governments and financial institutions are concerned about potential risks associated with money laundering, fraud, and financial stability.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Transparency:</strong> Some stablecoins lack transparency regarding their underlying reserves. Without adequate auditing and public reporting of reserve holdings, users may have doubts about the actual value and stability of the stablecoin, potentially undermining trust in the system.</li>
<li><strong>Price Volatility of Underlying Assets:</strong> Stablecoins pegged to specific commodities, such as gold or oil, may still be vulnerable to the price volatility of those assets. If the underlying asset experiences significant price fluctuations, it can impact the value of the stablecoin, deviating from its intended stability.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability and Network Congestion:</strong> Stablecoins built on certain blockchain platforms, like Ethereum, may encounter scalability issues and network congestion during periods of high transaction volume. This can result in increased transaction fees and slower transaction times, affecting the overall efficiency and user experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Some valuable examples of stablecoins to keep in mind</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tether (USDT):</strong> It is one of the main stablecoins in terms of market capitalization. It is backed by dollars, with its reserves physically held in bank accounts under the name of Tether Limited. In addition to USDT, Tether Limited is also responsible for issuing stablecoins anchored to the euro. Tether has faced scrutiny regarding the management of its dollar reserves. The lack of specific information about the assets and banks involved raised concerns. Nevertheless, Tether USDT remains one of the most widely capitalized stablecoins.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>True USD (TUSD):</strong> It is another physically backed stablecoin tied to the US dollar. The token was launched in 2018 on the Ethereum blockchain, using an ERC-20 contract as its foundation. Although True USD is the token issuer, the stablecoin&#8217;s reserves are held by a group of accredited financial institutions. True USD is obligated to publish the contents of its bank accounts regularly and undergo monthly audits conducted by third parties.</li>
<li><strong>Pax Gold (PAXG):</strong> Is backed by gold, making it one of the few stablecoins collateralized by commodities. According to Paxos specifications, each PAXG token represents one troy ounce of a London Good Delivery gold bar. These bars, each containing 400 ounces, are stored in Brink&#8217;s vaults under the name of Paxos Trust Company.</li>
<li><strong>Dai (DAI):</strong> Developed by the MakerDAO initiative, DAI is one of the most widely used asset-backed stablecoins on the Ethereum network. <strong>Unlike Tether, it operates in a decentralized manner with its own governance system,</strong> regulated by its smart contract. DAI does not have physical reserves to back its issuance. Instead, users guarantee the minting of new tokens by depositing Ether (ETH) or other cryptographic assets into the MakerDAO smart contract. In return for the deposited cryptocurrencies, they receive a token that maintains a 1:1 parity with the US dollar. DAI plays a significant role in shaping the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem: it serves as a widely utilized asset in lending platforms and decentralized exchanges (DEX).</li>
<li><strong><strong>Binance USD (BUSD):</strong></strong>Thanks to Paxos Standard and Binance, it has been ranked as the third-largest stablecoin by market cap. The BUSD stablecoin maintains a peg of 1:1 with US dollars, which implies that each BUSD is traded for $1 from the reserves. BUSD is a fiat-collateralized stablecoin. Paxos burns your BUSD when you submit it to them, then sends you their fiat substitute.</li>
<li><strong>USD Coin (USDC): </strong>This stablecoin has a 1:1 value correlation with the US dollar. It is accessible on several blockchains, including Ethereum, Algorand, BNB Smart Chain, Solana, Polygon, and Tron, and it provides liquidity to the cryptocurrency markets. In essence, USDC is an ERC20 utility token, which is a protocol for creating smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.</li>
<li><strong>USB:</strong> This stablecoin is backed by Bitcoin and is specifically designed to mirror the value of the US Dollar using a unique approach: shorting Bitcoin! By doing so, it eliminates the necessity for traditional bank accounts, providing protection against crackdowns or frozen funds, and enhancing privacy and resilience. You can learn more about USB project <a href="https://stabolut.com/">here.</a></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>But&#8230;. what is a memecoin, actually?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Innovation and inventiveness continue to push boundaries in the wide and dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. The rise of <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/memecoin/">meme tokens</a> is an intriguing trend that has occurred recently. These virtual currencies have gained popularity, attracting the interest of both crypto experts and fans of popular online memes.</p>
<p>During what is now referred to as &#8220;crypto meme season&#8221;, the idea of meme tokens significantly gained traction in crypto world. It refers to a time when the value and ubiquity of numerous digital currencies inspired by memes increased, mostly due to social media buzz and viral marketing activities. <strong>The emergence of the &#8220;crypto meme season&#8221; dissolved the distinction between digital assets and online culture, resulting in a distinctive and alluring trend in cryptocurrency industry.</strong></p>
<p>Although meme tokens frequently cause controversy, it is undeniable that they have the power to captivate an increasing number of crypto fans. Even if a meme coin does not have large use cases (as could be Cardano and Ethereum), it becomes a strong social symbol, which leads its owner to feel part of a community and reinforce his or her identity.</p>
<p>The close ties between the crypto industry and internet culture are to blame for the popularity of meme tokens like PEPE. <strong>These tokens capitalize on a sizable online community that relies on sharing and engaging with humorous and relatable material by embracing memes.</strong></p>
<p>Investors seeking to profit from the market craze surrounding these digital assets frequently turn to meme tokens. Although the prices of these tokens can fluctuate greatly, the possibility of substantial short-term gains has attracted a lot of traders to the meme token market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The latest successful meme coins in DEXTools (linked to charts)</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/es/ether/pair-explorer/0xbe8bc29765e11894f803906ee1055a344fdf2511">$BOB:</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It is the most recent meme token depicting PEPE the Frog. Just two weeks after its release, it experienced a massive 4,744% price increase. It&#8217;s actually the meme behind the &#8220;Bob Is Here To Explain&#8221; twitter account, an AI bot created to respond to anyone who tags @ExplainThisBob in a particular tweet.

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/es/ether/pair-explorer/0xcbe856765eeec3fdc505ddebf9dc612da995e593">$LADYS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The price of the LADYS token is still hovering 300 times above its launch-day low, demonstrating the token&#8217;s appeal on the charts. This meme tokenomics started with a huge total supply of more over 888 trillion, which is very typical for a meme coin. However, the vast bulk of the supply was received by the liquidity pool.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/es/ether/pair-explorer/0x42d403ab9b0603442ac991c0cfe124105dde0811">$PSYOP</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This token pretends to redefine relationship between creators and investors. In just one day since debut, $PSYOP was added to CoinMarketCap.<strong> It was trending first on DEXTools,</strong> and has a market valuation of $6 million—almost a 30k% rise from the launch price!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/es/ether/pair-explorer/0x6c4c7f46d9d4ef6bc5c9e155f011ad19fc4ef321">$RFD</a></li>
</ul>
<p>REFUND $RFD is a community driven token which is based on Ethereum. On May 19, 2023, it made a huge splash, and It is intended as an adventurous game theory experiment and a way to give back to the community that helped it succeed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>What is DeFi and how did it all start?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The acronym <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/defi/">DeFi</a> stands for Decentralized Finance. It refers to a series of applications and protocols based on the peer-to-peer principle (“without intermediaries”) developed on the blockchain and supported by networks that do not require any central control system</strong> <strong>for their governance.</strong> Its historical origin and current main base is the Ethereum network and its smart contracts, which allow DeFi system to give access to and articulate all types of financial operations.</p>
<p>Prior to the emergence of DeFi (and its DEXs), smart contracts were limited to emulating the traditional analogue FIAT financial system, but almost exactly like the more modern digital blockchain, with the only nuance (as in the case of Bitcoin) of decentralising the issuance and storage of currencies. But DeFi protocol burst in to eliminate any possible remnants of centralisation and bureaucracy, democratising the exchange of assets, and, in the process, widening the range of possibilities for the global financial system, opening up a new era.</p>
<p><strong> DeFi works through decentralised cryptocurrency exchanges called <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/dex/">DEXs,</a> which basically differ from centralised exchanges or <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/cex/">CEXs</a> in that DEXs (unlike CEXs) do not require you to register or hand over control of your cryptocurrencies</strong> to a third party to sign transactions on your behalf. You are the sole holder of the private keys to your funds, and everything is confirmed on-chain.</p>
<p>In DEXs, everything is executed on the same blockchain and through smart contracts, which are simple self-executing agreements between peers written in code, designed to guarantee the security, confidentiality, immutability, anonymity, decentralisation and scalability of cryptocurrency transactions.</p>
<p>For their part, CEXs act as regulated entities that offer digital users a service similar to that of traditional banking, holding funds in user-friendly platforms and even securing them.</p>
<p>An important point in the comparison of CEX and DEX is liquidity, that is, the degree of ease of buying and selling at a reasonable price, which is higher in CEXs today. But on DEX there is a greater variety of tokens available, which increases the opportunity to find so called &#8220;gems&#8221;, which are innovative and valuable tokens and projects.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: right;"></h3>
<h3>What types of DEXs are there?</h3>
<p>Three distinct types of DEX exchanges are available:</p>
<p><strong>1-Market makers (AAMs).</strong> They use so-called liquidity pools, which are funded by users who, in return, get the right to benefit from the transaction fees that the protocol charges for executing trades on a pair.</p>
<p><strong>2-DEX order books.</strong> These books keep track of each open order to buy and sell assets for specific pairs.</p>
<p><strong>3-DEX aggregators.</strong> Their function is basically to aggregate the liquidity of several DEXs to reduce slippage on large orders, and to optimise rates and prices in the shortest possible time.  The idea is to provide the user with a wide range of useful tools in a single interface, to reduce the number of failed trades, and to offer more favorable comparative exchange rates than a single isolated DEX would allow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>What is happening in crypto market?</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cryptocurrencies have fallen sharply globally in recent years,</strong> with a $2 trillion decline in value after the 2021 rally. Bitcoin, the world&#8217;s leading cryptoasset, has lost 70% since its all-time high in November, when it reached $69,000. This situation corresponds to a new long bear market known as the &#8220;crypto-winter&#8221; or &#8220;bear market&#8221;, the last of which took place between 2017 and 2018.</p>
<p>According to experts,<strong> the current bear market context is due to the fact that the general economy in crisis, coupled with inflation and rising interest rates, has put unsustainable pressure on an over-leveraged crypto ecosystem,</strong> whose funds have become, incidentally, the prime target for liquidators seeking to cash them out in a hurry.</p>
<p>With crypto spot values falling below price, traders have been forced to sell at a loss, liquidating holdings. This has generated a domino effect typical of bearish trading, dragging the market down.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the midst of the bear phase (the current one), expert bitcoiners and miners are holding out and following a long-term strategy, accumulating as much bitcoin as possible and participating in reliable projects, while waiting for demand to be restored.</p>
<p>In the end, the bull market/bear market loop rewards the patient, and punishes both hurried speculators and hesitant investors who are late to enter the bull phase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>How to deal with this bear market &amp; what will the future look like?</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Actually the bear market, although worrying, is a good context for long-term investment.</strong> Market cycles last about 4 years from top to bottom, and the current cycle, which started in 2020, still has time for a full recovery until the next bull market.</p>
<p>Most of the<a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/bitcoin/"> Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> (the two main cryptocurrencies) reserves, are in the hands of about 10,000 investors, who control 1/3 of the total number of tokens in circulation. As they are few and experienced, the hypothetical collapse of their investments could not cause a real cataclysm.</p>
<p>On the other hand, and despite the growing regulatory pressure on cryptocurrencies exerted by some governments (or even direct blocking, as in Kazakhstan or China), there are also cases of support for crypto growth, such as that of Mexico by facilitating credits for mining, or the well-known officialization of Bitcoin in El Salvador. And, above all, there is the tacit support of the United States, which seems to be playing a double game in the matter: by tightening regulation on the one hand, but also allowing the launch on <a href="https://info.dextools.io/crypto-glossary/fomo/">Bitcoin Futures Exchange</a>-traded funds (ETF), which promise to inject great liquidity into crypto ecosystem indirectly.</p>
<p>In addition, payment gateways have strengthened their support for crypto transactions, and, in general, web and crypto technology continues to advance with the sophistication of the various apps and devices (e.g. DeFi). And also with the slow but unstoppable adherence to the blockchain of the main players on the Web 2.0.</p>
<p><strong> All that remains is for confidence to gradually recover.</strong> And for the crypto economy to become popular as an everyday payment method. This would consolidate it completely, making it more efficient and stronger in the face of global crises such as the one we are currently experiencing.</p>
