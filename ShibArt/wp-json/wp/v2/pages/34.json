Our goal is to provide a cheap, efficient, and user-friendly dApp to generate the highest quality images and videos, while simultaneously allowing anyone to earn passive income by contributing their idle GPU power to the network.<\/h2><h2><br><\/h2><h2>In the rapidly evolving digital art space, technologies like Midjourney and Dall-E have paved the way for advanced generation techniques. However, the high cost of generation and poor user experience have limited their accessibility to the broader public. Shibart tackles these issues and democratizes the profitability of Midjourney and others.<\/h2><h2><br><\/h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shibart&#8217;s innovative approach relies on the collective power of a distributed network of GPUs, allowing users to access vast computing resources at a fraction of the cost of traditional platforms. As a result, Shibart remains decentralized and capital efficient.<\/strong><\/p><p><br><\/p>\n<p><font color=\"#bbbbbb\"><strong>At the heart of the Shibart experience is a sleek and user-friendly web app, designed to make the process of generating digital art as simple as possible. Users are able to publish images from their private gallery to the public gallery and easily download their images or share them on social media.<\/strong><\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#bbbbbb\"><strong><br><\/strong><\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#bbbbbb\"><strong>Users can easily connect their ERC20 wallets, buy and stake $SART, and begin generating images and videos in a matter of seconds.<\/strong><\/font><\/p><p><br><\/p>\n\n\n<p><font color=\"#bbbbbb\"><strong>Shibart\u2019s AI engine is poised to outpace all existing visual AI generators, thanks to its ability to easily adopt open source checkpoints and to be as competitively priced as possible. By embracing the collaborative spirit of the global developer community, Shibart ensures continuous improvement, innovation, and optimization of its algorithms and underlying technology.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/font><\/p><p><br><\/p>\n<p><font color=\"#bbbbbb\"><strong>Tokens are used to pay for GPU processing power from miners in order to generate images and videos. To spend the tokens, they must be staked first. The more you stake, the more benefits you unlock on the platform. Staked tokens can also be used to tip other users if you enjoy their content.<\/strong><\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#bbbbbb\"><strong><br><\/strong><\/font><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>$SART: THE FUEL<\/h2>\n<h2>The $SART token serves as a means of exchange within the Shibart ecosystem. It allows users to pay for image and video generation services and is given to GPU owners as a reward for lending their processing power to the network. By using a dedicated cryptocurrency, we ensure an anonymous and transparent experience for all.<\/h2><h2><br><\/h2><h2>Key Benefits of $SART:<\/h2><h2>Easy payments for image and video generation services;<\/h2><h2>Lend GPU bandwidth to the network to earn;<\/h2><h2>Tradable on popular cryptocurrency exchanges;<\/h2><h2>Stake to earn and vote in the DAO;<\/h2><div><br><\/div>\n\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":0,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/tokenventurecapital.org\/ShibArt\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/34"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/tokenventurecapital.org\/ShibArt\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/tokenventurecapital.org\/ShibArt\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/tokenventurecapital.org\/ShibArt\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=34"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/tokenventurecapital.org\/ShibArt\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/34\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":55,"href":"https:\/\/tokenventurecapital.org\/ShibArt\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/34\/revisions\/55"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/tokenventurecapital.org\/ShibArt\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=34"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
